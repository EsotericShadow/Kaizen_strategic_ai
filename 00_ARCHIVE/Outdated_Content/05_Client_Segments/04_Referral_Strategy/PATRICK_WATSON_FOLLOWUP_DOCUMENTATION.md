### Gabriel's Initial Message
"Hi Patrick,

Thanks again for coming out the other night, it really helped ease my nerves knowing there were some people in the audience who knew my family.

I'm reaching out because I'm in the process of incorporating my business and was advised to connect with a reliable accountant and bookkeeper. My grandpa mentioned that you handle their accounting, and I wanted to see if you also work with incorporated businesses.

If so, I'd love to discuss whether you're taking on new clients.

Best,
Gabriel Lacroix"

### Patrick's Response
"Yes, thanks for touching base with me. Yes we can assist with your business. First step is to contact your friendly lawyer to help you incorporate your company.

Thanks

Patrick Watson"
