## Communication Exchange

### Gabriel's Offer
"Hey Jack, thanks for coming out on Thursday I really appreciate it.

I'd like to offer you a Digital Strategy session focused on AI. I think your business in particular has a lot of opportunities where AI could make a real impact.

Every business operates differently, and what I shared at the event only scratched the surface. If we sat down for an hour or two and walked through your systems and processes, I could show you some specific ways you could start seeing results right away."

### Jack's Response
"Sounds interesting. I'd like to take you up on that but business has really slowed down the last few months and funds are an issue. I would expect to pay you for your time but can't afford anything right now. I am very interested in AI and how I can use it."

### Gabriel's Solution
"What if we could get funding for it? Like a grant, and I wouldn't mind taking a risk to try it out and be paid later.

Also it's really beneficial for me to have an active case study I can reference on meetings. I'll make money off of it"

### Jack's Interest
"Where can we get a grant? Perhaps Brian could help?"

### Gabriel's Confirmation
"Yes, he knows of a program that's tailored to what I'm doing, and I think we might be eligible for this"

### Jack's Action
"Check with him"
