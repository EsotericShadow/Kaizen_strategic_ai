### Gabriel's Initial Message
"Hey Jo and Trevor,

Thanks a bunch for coming! It was awesome to see so many friendly faces in the audience.

I didn't get a chance to chat with you before you left, but I really wish I had. I was hoping to get some feedback on the presentation. Did you pick up anything new? Did I say something silly? Any feedback would be super helpful to me.

I'd love to hear more about your operations and see if there's anything I can do to help out.

Gabriel,

### Trevor & Jo's Response
"Hi Gabriel, 

Thank-you very much for hosting the information session, I thought you did very well as a whole. There is only a couple of things that stood out to me as something that might benefit your presentation. 

Remember to breath, you're a subject matter expert in this and you're passionate about it, I can tell clearly, let that shine. The second is; talking about lots of examples of various real life use cases was brilliant and you need to flesh that out more. 

It's not rambling if it's from the heart 🙂

A little about us, Jo and I have recently moved to Terrace and are starting up an HVAC business as of next Monday (WildAir HVAC). 

Your presentation was very helpful in that you told us if various methods of use that we hadn't thought about, ie. Asking for answers or feedback from various perspectives. I know this is only scratching the surface of what is possible, and we're seeing more as we research. We have a Google workspace subscription and we get a paid version of Gemini with that, though in my experience it lacks greatly on the free version in comparison to something like ChatGPT but I can see the way Google has built this functionality into just about every dinner of their organization so, I can see it will be helpful in some way. 

Thank-you for reaching out. I suspect we will be in contact in the near future.

Best regards, 
Jo and Trevor"
