### Kathy's Message
"Hi, this two hour presentation sounds interesting regarding AI. Today has been one of the worst days weather wise. Will you host on another date and time? Perhaps 6-8? Most people are off work at 4:30 or 5pm. Thank you. T'ooyaḵsiy̓ n̓isim̓, Kathy"

### Gabriel's Response
"Hey thank you so much for expressing interest! Gosh I know! It was raining cats and dogs here haha

Absolutely! I will start planning to host another event soon, I'll keep you updated on when that will be. 

However, If you're interested, I would be open to meeting up for a coffee and having a discussion about AI. I could gauge where you're at and give you a condensed version of the presentation just focusing on your own ideas! 

Cheers,
