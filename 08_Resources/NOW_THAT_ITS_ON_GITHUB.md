# What's Next Now That It's on GitHub

**Repository**: https://github.com/EsotericShadow/nc-ai-templates  
**Status**: ✅ Template is live and public

---

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### 1. Set Up GitHub Pages (5 minutes)
**Free website hosting from your repo**

1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: `main` / `/ (root)`
4. Save
5. **Result**: Your README becomes a website at `EsotericShadow.github.io/nc-ai-templates`

**Why**: Gives you a simple website without building anything

---

### 2. Add Repository Metadata (2 minutes)
**Make it discoverable**

In your repository:
1. **Add Topics** (Settings → Topics):
   - `ai-governance`
   - `iso-42001`
   - `risk-management`
   - `northern-bc`
   - `templates`
   - `artificial-intelligence`
   - `compliance`

2. **Verify Description** is set:
   ```
   ISO 42001-aligned AI governance templates for Northern BC / Northern Cascadia. Draft for public comment. Free to use.
   ```

**Why**: Helps people find it via search

---

### 3. Share It Once (10 minutes)
**Get the word out**

**On LinkedIn**:
- Post: "Just published NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template (Draft for Public Comment). ISO 42001-aligned template with 28 pre-populated risks for Northern BC businesses. Feedback welcome: [GitHub link]"

**Email Key Contacts** (5-10 people):
- Chamber of Commerce contacts
- NDIT contacts
- Business contacts you know
- Subject: "Free AI Governance Template for Northern BC"

**Why**: Low effort, might get some downloads

---

### 4. Use It Yourself
**Lead by example**

- Use the template in your own consulting work
- Reference it in proposals: "Based on NC-AI-001 framework"
- Show clients you have this resource

**Why**: Real usage = credibility

---

## Short-Term (Next Month)

### 5. Monitor What Happens
- Check GitHub for stars/forks
- See if anyone opens issues
- Track if you get any feedback
- Watch downloads (if you add analytics later)

**Don't expect much** - That's fine. The goal is "it exists and is available."

---

### 6. Create First Release (Optional)
**Tag v1.0 officially**

1. Go to repository → Releases → Create a new release
2. Tag: `v1.0-draft`
3. Title: "NC-AI-001 v1.0 Draft for Public Comment"
4. Description: Brief summary
5. Attach zip file if you want (or just link to files)

**Why**: Makes it look more official

---

## Medium-Term (Next 3 Months)

### 7. Iterate Based on Feedback (IF you get any)
- If someone suggests improvements → implement
- If someone reports a bug → fix it
- Version to v1.1 based on feedback
- Or: Don't change anything if no one uses it (also fine)

---

### 8. Build on It IF It Gets Traction
**Only if people actually use it:**

- IF you get 10+ stars → consider NC-AI-002
- IF you get feedback → iterate
- IF people ask for more → expand
- IF no one uses it → that's fine, you still have a useful template

---

## What NOT to Do Right Now

❌ Don't build a whole website  
❌ Don't spend money on marketing  
❌ Don't create more templates yet  
❌ Don't worry about expert review (can do later)  
❌ Don't stress about adoption numbers  
❌ Don't overthink it

**Remember**: "Post it, see what happens, build on it ONLY if people use it."

---

## The Realistic Timeline

### This Week
✅ GitHub Pages (free website)  
✅ Add topics/metadata  
✅ Share once on LinkedIn  
✅ Email a few contacts  

### This Month
- Use it in your own work
- Monitor for any interest
- Don't worry if nothing happens

### Next 3 Months
- Only do more IF it gets traction
- Otherwise: It exists, it's available, done

---

## Success Metrics (Realistic)

### Minimum Success (What to Expect)
- 5-10 GitHub stars
- Maybe 1-2 issues/feedback items
- You use it yourself
- ✅ **That's success. That's enough.**

### Actual Success (If It Works)
- 20+ stars
- People start using it
- You get requests for more
- ✅ **THEN invest more time**

### No Success (Also Fine)
- Few or no stars
- No feedback
- No one uses it
- ✅ **Still useful for your own work. No loss.**

---

## Bottom Line

**What you did**: Put a quality template on GitHub ✅

**What's next**: 
1. Set up GitHub Pages (free website)
2. Share it once
3. Use it yourself
4. See what happens
5. Build on it ONLY if people use it

**The energy**: "It's out there. If people find it useful, great. If not, I still have a useful template."

**Remember**: You're not betting the farm on this. You're just putting it out there.
