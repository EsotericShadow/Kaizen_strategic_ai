# Simple, Realistic Plan

**The Question**: "Are we maybe biting off more than we can chew?"

**The Answer**: Yes, probably. Let's simplify.

## What You Actually Have

✅ **One good template** (NC-AI-001)
✅ **Professional packaging** (PDF, Word, CSV)
✅ **ISO-aligned content** (28 risks, 8 categories)
✅ **Clean directory structure** (ready to share)

**That's actually enough.** You don't need everything else right now.

## The Simple Version (What You Can Actually Do)

### Option 1: Just Post It
1. Put template on your existing website (or GitHub Pages)
2. Label it "Draft for Public Comment v1.0"
3. Add simple download link
4. Share on LinkedIn once
5. Done

**Time**: 1-2 days  
**Cost**: $0 (use GitHub Pages if no website yet)  
**Complexity**: Minimal

**Outcome**: Template is publicly available. If people use it, great. If not, you still have a useful template for your own work.

---

### Option 2: Post It + Basic Promotion
1. Post template (same as Option 1)
2. Email 5-10 key contacts (Chamber, NDIT, local businesses you know)
3. Post on LinkedIn with brief explanation
4. Add "feedback welcome" email

**Time**: 2-3 days  
**Cost**: $0  
**Complexity**: Low

**Outcome**: Template is available + some people know about it. If they use it, great. If not, no loss.

---

### Option 3: Post It + Expert Review (If You Want)
1. Get one ISO expert to review (optional, not required)
2. Post template
3. Add "Reviewed by [Expert Name]" if you get review
4. Share once

**Time**: 1 week (if expert available)  
**Cost**: $500-2000 (if you pay for review)  
**Complexity**: Medium

**Outcome**: Template with expert validation. Slightly more credibility. Not required to start.

## What You DON'T Need Right Now

❌ Building a whole new website  
❌ Creating GitHub repository  
❌ Submitting to ISO resource lists  
❌ Writing press releases  
❌ Creating institutional branding  
❌ ISO certification (yet)  
❌ Partnerships (yet)  
❌ Vertical templates (yet)  
❌ Multiple standards (yet)  
❌ Summit planning (yet)  
❌ Northern Cascadia Institute (yet)

**All that stuff can come LATER if this actually gets used.**

## The Realistic Approach

### Phase 1: Just Put It Out There (Now)
- Post template online
- Make it downloadable
- Label "Draft for Public Comment"
- Done

**Time**: 1-2 days  
**Energy**: Low  
**Risk**: Minimal

### Phase 2: See What Happens (1-3 Months)
- Check if anyone downloads it
- See if you get any feedback
- Use it in your own consulting work
- Iterate if needed

**Time**: Ongoing (low effort)  
**Energy**: Low  
**Risk**: None

### Phase 3: Build on It IF People Use It (3-12 Months)
- IF people use it → invest more time
- IF people ask for more → create NC-AI-002
- IF you get feedback → iterate and version
- IF it gets traction → THEN consider bigger investments

**Time**: Only if needed  
**Energy**: Only if traction  
**Risk**: Only if you over-invest

---

## The "Too Much" Test

**If you're asking "are we biting off more than we can chew?"** → Yes, you probably are.

**The fix**: Do LESS, not more.

**Start with**: Just posting the template online.

**Then**: Wait and see.

**Then**: Build on it ONLY if people actually use it.

---

## What "Success" Looks Like (Realistic)

### Minimum Success
- Template is publicly available
- You use it in your own work
- You can point to it as "something I created"
- **That's it. That's enough.**

### Medium Success
- 10-50 downloads in first 6 months
- Someone says "this is useful"
- You get one piece of feedback
- **Good progress. Keep going.**

### Actual Success
- People start using it
- You get requests for more templates
- It becomes a talking point in your consulting
- **THEN invest more time.**

## The Bottom Line

**You have**: One good template, professionally packaged

**You need**: A way to share it (website or GitHub Pages)

**You DON'T need**: Everything else right now

**The plan**: Post it, see what happens, build on it IF it gets traction

**The energy**: "Let's just put it out there and see"

**The reality**: One template shared is better than 10 templates planned

---

## The Simplest Next Step

1. **Today**: Upload template to GitHub Pages (free, 30 minutes)
2. **This week**: Share link on LinkedIn once
3. **This month**: Use it in your own work
4. **Later**: Only do more if people actually use it

**That's it. That's the plan.**

Everything else in `NEXT_STEPS_ACTION_PLAN.md` can wait. Do that stuff ONLY if this gets traction.

## Remember

**"I'm just a pothead"** = Stay humble, don't over-invest

**"Who the fuck am I"** = Don't claim authority you don't have

**"Just seems like pie in the sky"** = Keep it real, do less

**"Build it and invite people"** = That's the plan. Simple.

**The chances it gets adopted?** Unknown. That's fine. You're not betting the farm on it. You're just putting it out there.

---

**TL;DR**: Post the template. See what happens. Don't overthink it. Don't over-invest. Build on it ONLY if people use it.
