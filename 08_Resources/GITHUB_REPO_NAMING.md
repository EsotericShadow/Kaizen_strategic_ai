# GitHub Repository Naming Options

## Recommended: `nc-ai-templates`

**Why this is best**:
- ✅ Matches your NC-AI-001 naming convention
- ✅ Clear what it is (templates, not claiming to be standards)
- ✅ Short and memorable
- ✅ Professional but not overreaching
- ✅ Easy to find: `github.com/kaizenstrategic/nc-ai-templates`

---

## Other Options

### `nc-ai-governance-templates`
**Pros**: More descriptive  
**Cons**: Longer, maybe too formal  
**Best for**: If you want to be extra clear it's governance-related

### `kaizen-nc-ai-templates`
**Pros**: Includes company name for ownership  
**Cons**: Redundant if username is already kaizenstrategic  
**Best for**: If using different GitHub username

### `northern-cascadia-ai-templates`
**Pros**: Full name, very clear  
**Cons**: Long, harder to type/remember  
**Best for**: If you want maximum clarity

### `nc-ai-standards` (what you mentioned earlier)
**Pros**: Short, professional  
**Cons**: "Standards" might claim too much authority  
**Best for**: If you're comfortable claiming "standards" status

## My Recommendation

**Use: `nc-ai-templates`**

**Full URL**: `github.com/kaizenstrategic/nc-ai-templates`

**Why**:
1. Matches your naming (NC-AI-001, NC-AI-002, etc.)
2. Says "templates" not "standards" (humble, realistic)
3. Short enough to remember and share
4. Professional but not overreaching
5. Clear what it is

## My Pick

**Use this version (with local keywords)**:
```

```

**Why**:

## Alternative: Organization Account?

If you want to separate from personal account:
- Create `northern-cascadia-ai` organization
- Repo: `northern-cascadia-ai/templates`
- Or: `northern-cascadia-ai/nc-ai-templates`

**But**: This is overkill for one template. Start with personal account, can move later.

---

## Final Answer

**Repository Name**: `nc-ai-templates`  
**Full URL**: `github.com/kaizenstrategic/nc-ai-templates`  
**Username**: `kaizenstrategic` (or your existing GitHub username)

**Keep it simple. You can always rename later.**
