What We Did NOT Include in This Review Package
===============================================

We deliberately kept this folder simple with ONLY the 3 files you need.

We DID NOT include:
- All the strategic planning documents
- Development working files
- Publication packaging files
- Archived materials
- Internal notes and decisions

IF YOU WANT MORE DETAIL:

Everything else is in the parent folder structure:
- 08_Resources/NC_AI_Standards/Development/
- 08_Resources/NC_AI_Standards/Planning/
- 08_Resources/NC_AI_Standards/Publication/
- 08_Resources/ISO_42001/

But for this review, we only need your feedback on:
1. Is it ISO 42001 compliant? ✅
2. Any errors? ❌
3. Would you endorse it? 💼

That's it!
