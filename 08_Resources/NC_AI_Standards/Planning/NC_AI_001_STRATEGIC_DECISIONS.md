**Last Updated**: Q4 2025  
**Decision Authority**: Gabriel Lacroix  
**Strategic Context**: Building monopoly through standards architecture

---

## Core Strategic Foundation

### Decision #1: First-Mover Advantage Strategy
**Date**: Strategic Planning Session  
**Context**: Identifying competitive moats beyond initial advantages

**The Recognition**:
- Solo founder agility
- First mover advantage in Northern BC
- Monopoly by standards architecture (legal compliance positioning)
- Superior branding
- Media presence

**The Question**: "What else can we do to secure the market?"

**Decision**: **Establish ourselves as the de facto standards authority through pre-emptive knowledge products.**

**Rationale**: While others wait to react to regulation, we create the templates, frameworks, and reference materials that everyone else will cite. This isn't just market positioning - it's legacy institution building.

---

## Northern Cascadia AI Governance Initiative

### Decision #2: Regional Authority Through Free Templates
**Date**: Strategic Planning Session  
**Priority**: High - Weekend Project

**The Plan**:
1. Publish first Northern BC AI Risk Register template
2. **Price**: $0 (free public resource)
3. **Time**: One weekend
4. **Effect**: Become the authority, unbeatable in the mindshare race

**Decision**: **Build comprehensive, iron-clad, formulaic templates as public resources.**

**Why Free?**
- Adoption beats monetization at this stage
- First citation creates authority
- Template adoption = mindshare capture
- When regulation comes, we're the reference
- "No one can contest it when we cite it"

**Research Depth Requirement**: Deep research, iron-clad foundations - not AI-generated fluff.

---

## Template Strategy Decisions

### Decision #3: Generic + Vertical Templates
**Context**: Determining scope of template offerings

**Discussion**: 
- Generic templates? (3 rows = too simple)
- Vertical-specific templates? (20+ rows = depth)
- Future-proofing considerations

**Decision**: **Create both generic formulaic templates AND comprehensive vertical templates.**

**Rationale**:
- Generic provides accessibility and broad adoption
- Vertical templates provide depth for specific industries
- Together, they cover the entire market spectrum
- Formulaic generic = easy adoption
- Rich verticals = professional authority

**Vertical Development**: Start with key Northern BC industries:
- Resource Sector (Mining, Forestry, Oil & Gas)
- Healthcare & Medical
- Financial Services
- Professional Services
- Manufacturing & Industrial

---

## Brand Architecture Strategy

### Decision #4: Domain Strategy
**Context**: Managing brand transitions and web presence

**The Question**: Domain forwarding strategy for evergreenwebsolutions.ca?

**Decision**: **Forward to kaizenstrategic.ai (not .com or .ca for now)**

**Rationale**: 
- .ai TLD signals AI expertise
- Platform for both Canadian (.ca) and international (.com) messaging
- Forward old domain like Twitter → X transition
- Maintain SEO value while modernizing brand
- Position as modern, forward-thinking

**Primary Domains**:
- kaizenstrategic.ai (main)
- kaizenstrategic.ai.com (backup)
- kaizenstrategic.ai.ca (backup)

---

## Content Strategy: Expertise + Accessibility

### Decision #5: Dual-Language Content Approach
**Context**: ISO expert collaboration for template creation

**The Challenge**: 
- Need ISO expert for accuracy
- Need to avoid "ISOese" (technical jargon)
- Need layman's terms for small business

**Decision**: **Collaborate with ISO expert + enforce English translation.**

**Process**:
1. ISO expert ensures technical accuracy
2. Translate all ISO terminology to plain English
3. Every template has both:
   - Technical accuracy (ISO-compliant)
   - Practical usability (small business accessible)

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents "AI generated" look (~20 items = obvious template)
- Real expertise shows in nuanced depth
- True understanding beats regurgitation
- Templates become referencable authorities
- Small businesses can actually use them

---

## Regional Positioning: Why Northern BC?

### Decision #6: "Northern Cascadia" Regional Framing
**Context**: Community framing vs broader Canadian positioning

**The Concern**: "What's the difference between that and any other Canada area?"

**Decision**: **Position as "Northern Cascadia" - distinct regional identity**

**Rationale**:
- Northern Cascadia sounds legitimate and professional
- Creates unique regional identity
- Differentiates from generic "Northern BC" or "Canada-wide"
- Suggests ecosystem/community level thinking
- Professional brand positioning

**Regional Definition**: North of Prince George (de facto regional boundary)

**Vision**: "If you're doing AI north of Prince George, we want to know about it AND control your cash flow."

---

## Institutional Building: Beyond Entrepreneurial

### Decision #7: Transition to Legacy Institution
**Context**: Standards setting body mindset shift

**The Revelation**: "We are a standard setting body. It's beyond the entrepreneurial mindset here. This is legacy building, empire sprouting planning."

**Decision**: **Build Kaizen Strategic AI as launching pad for institutional entity**

**Future Vision**: 
- Kaizen Strategic AI leads to new institution

**The Concern**: Publishing templates without full understanding

**Decision**: **Publish as research-based frameworks, certify separately**

**Rationale**:
- Deep research = true understanding
- Templates based on ISO 42001 principles, not exact replication
- "Working towards ISO 42001" positioning acceptable
- Templates ≠ certification requirement
- Certify Kaizen while publishing templates for market

**Process**:
1. Research ISO 42001 deeply
2. Create templates based on principles
3. Publish as public resources
4. Pursue certification for Kaizen
5. Templates become reference materials

---

## The "Monopoly" Strategy (Legal Positioning)

### Decision #11: Market Domination Framing
**Context**: Building aggressive market share without legal monopoly

**The Concept**: "Monopolies are illegal, but we can be so aggressive that the market share just prefers us"

**Decision**: **Aggressive market capture through excellence, not exclusion**

**Mechanisms**:

### Decision #26: Realistic Community-Driven Approach
**Context**: Realizing the limits of solo authority and the reality of standards development

**The Realization**:
- "I can't just dictate the standard. Who the fuck am I?"
- "It feels too serious for me, I'm just a pothead"
- "The chances my standard templates are adopted?"
- Need to work WITH ISO, not replace it
- No permission needed - these are templates, not official standards
- Build it, post it professionally, invite comment, version it, let it grow

**Decision**: **Create templates as "Draft for Public Comment" and let adoption determine authority**

**The Realistic Process**:
1. Build professional templates (ISO-compliant)
2. Post them as "Draft for Public Comment"
3. Invite community feedback
4. Version based on comments
5. Let organic adoption establish authority
6. Don't claim authority - earn it through adoption

**Why This Works**:
- Honest about position ("just a pothead" = humble)
- Professional presentation creates credibility
- Public comment invites community ownership
- Versioning shows responsiveness
- Adoption over time = real authority
- No dictating = true standards process

**The Reality Check**:
- Can't just say "I'm the standard"
- Must earn authority through quality and adoption
- Community input essential for legitimacy
- "Just seems like a bunch of pie in the sky bs" = keep it real
- Growth happens organically, not through declaration

**The Approach**:
- Professional and authoritative presentation
- Open to feedback and iteration
- Version control for changes
- Let community decide if it's useful
- Build it, invite people, establish through adoption

**Key Insight**: "I just have to build it and invite people and that will establish me right?" - Yes, through quality + adoption, not declaration.
