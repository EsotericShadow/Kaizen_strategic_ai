# Why Does Northern BC Need Its Own AI Governance Lens?
## Consultation Whitepaper - Northern Cascadia Institute

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Draft for Public Comment  
**Purpose:** Establish the foundational case for regional AI governance standards

---

## Executive Summary

This whitepaper presents the case for regional AI governance standards specifically designed for Northern British Columbia. We argue that generic frameworks developed in urban centers, provincial capitals, or international standards bodies do not adequately address the unique contexts, risks, and governance structures of Northern BC.

**Key Question:** Why does Northern BC need its own AI governance lens?

**Answer:** Because Northern BC has distinct economic, cultural, governance, and technological contexts that require regionally-tailored standards. Generic frameworks assume contexts that don't exist in the North.

## The Problem: Generic Frameworks Don't Fit

### Urban Assumptions vs. Northern Reality

**Generic frameworks assume:**
- Large organizations with dedicated compliance teams
- High-speed internet and reliable connectivity
- Access to specialized AI expertise
- Urban economic models and business structures
- Centralized governance structures
- English-only considerations

**Northern BC reality:**
- Small organizations (5-50 employees) with limited resources
- Remote locations with connectivity challenges
- Limited local AI expertise
- Resource-based economies with unique risk profiles
- Multiple overlapping jurisdictions (municipal, Indigenous, provincial, federal)
- Multi-language considerations (Indigenous languages, regional dialects)

### The Gap This Creates

When organizations in Northern BC try to use generic AI governance frameworks:
- **They don't fit:** Templates assume large corporations, not 10-person businesses
- **They're too complex:** Designed for compliance teams, not business owners
- **They miss local risks:** Resource extraction AI, remote infrastructure, Indigenous data sovereignty
- **They ignore local governance:** Don't account for Indigenous sovereignty, regional decision-making
- **They're inaccessible:** Require expertise and resources many Northern BC organizations don't have

## What Makes Northern BC Unique

### 1. Economic Context

**Resource-Based Economies:**
- Mining, forestry, energy sectors have unique AI applications
- Long-term project cycles (decades, not quarters)
- Multi-generational knowledge transfer
- Environmental and safety considerations specific to resource extraction

**Small Business Dominance:**
- Most organizations are 5-50 employees
- Limited IT resources and expertise
- Need practical, accessible tools
- Can't afford expensive consultants or compliance teams

**Remote and Isolated:**
- Limited connectivity and infrastructure
- Different data sovereignty requirements
- Supply chain and logistics challenges
- Local expertise is critical

### 2. Cultural Context

**Distinct Regional Identity:**
- Northern BC has its own culture and way of life
- Strong community connections
- Intergenerational knowledge transfer
- Self-reliance and practical problem-solving traditions

**Relationship with Land and Resources:**
- Long-term relationship with territory
- Resource stewardship responsibilities
- Environmental considerations
- Cultural knowledge embedded in place

### 3. Governance Context

**Multiple Overlapping Jurisdictions:**
- Municipal governments
- Regional districts
- **Indigenous governments (sovereign nations)**
- Provincial government
- Federal government

**Indigenous Sovereignty:**
- Indigenous nations have jurisdiction over their territories
- Data sovereignty and Indigenous data rights
- Traditional knowledge protection
- Co-governance models

**Regional Autonomy:**
- Regional decision-making authority
- Community-driven solutions
- Local expertise and knowledge
- Northern BC-specific policies and programs

### 4. AI Risk Context

**Different Risk Profiles:**
- Resource extraction AI risks (mining, forestry, energy)
- Remote infrastructure AI risks
- Small organization AI risks
- Indigenous data sovereignty risks
- Community impact risks (not just corporate risks)

**Unique Applications:**
- AI in resource extraction and processing
- AI in remote infrastructure management
- AI in small business operations
- AI in Indigenous governance and services
- AI in community services (health, education, etc.)

## The Solution: Regional Standards

### What Regional Standards Provide

1. **Practical, Accessible Tools**
   - Designed for small organizations
   - No expensive consultants required
   - Step-by-step implementation guides
   - Real-world examples from Northern BC contexts

2. **Regionally-Tailored Risk Assessment**
   - Resource extraction AI risks
   - Remote infrastructure considerations
   - Small business contexts
   - Indigenous data sovereignty requirements

3. **Local Governance Integration**
   - Respects Indigenous sovereignty
   - Accounts for multiple jurisdictions
   - Supports regional decision-making
   - Community-driven development

4. **Alignment with International Standards**
   - Works WITH ISO 42001, not replacing it
   - Provides regional implementation guidance
   - Bridges global standards and local needs
   - Maintains compatibility while adding specificity

---

## Why Now?

### The Timing is Critical

1. **AI Adoption is Accelerating**
   - Organizations are adopting AI tools rapidly
   - Without governance, risks accumulate
   - Early governance prevents future problems

2. **External Regulation is Coming**
   - Provincial and federal AI frameworks are developing
   - If we wait, we'll be reacting instead of leading
   - Regional input now shapes future regulation

3. **First-Mover Advantage**
   - Establishing regional standards creates authority
   - Early frameworks become reference points
   - Regional expertise is recognized

4. **Indigenous Data Sovereignty Momentum**
   - OCAP® principles gaining recognition
   - Indigenous data governance frameworks emerging
   - Opportunity to integrate from the start

## Our Approach: Consultation First

### Before Standards: Consultation

**This whitepaper is the first step.** Before publishing standards, we're:

1. **Consulting with stakeholders:**
   - Indigenous governments
   - Municipal governments
   - Regional districts
   - Business organizations
   - Professional associations
   - Academic institutions
   - Community organizations

2. **Building consensus:**
   - What are the real AI risks in Northern BC?
   - What governance gaps exist?
   - What tools are needed?
   - How should standards be developed?

3. **Establishing principles:**
   - Founding principles (see separate document)
   - Core values and approaches
   - Governance structure
   - Development process

4. **Then developing standards:**
   - Based on consultation feedback
   - Reflecting regional needs
   - Co-developed with stakeholders
   - Practical and accessible
