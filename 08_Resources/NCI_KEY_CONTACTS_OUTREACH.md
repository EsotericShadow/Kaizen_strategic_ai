## Tier 1: Critical Partners (Priority Outreach)

### 1. First Nations Technology Council (FNTC)

**Why Critical**: Indigenous data sovereignty is core to NCI's mission. FNTC is the authoritative voice.

**Contact Information**:
- **Organization**: First Nations Technology Council
- **Email**: info@technologycouncil.ca
- **Website**: technologycouncil.ca
- **CEO**: Denise Williams (find via LinkedIn)
- **Location**: Vancouver (serves all BC First Nations)

**Current Activities**:
- AI needs surveys among First Nations (deadline May 2025)
- OCAP® principles (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession)
- Data sovereignty frameworks
- Nation-building through technology

**Partnership Opportunities**:
1. Co-develop NC-AI-006: Indigenous Data Sovereignty Protocol
2. Joint workshops on AI governance for Indigenous governments
3. FNTC endorsement of NC-AI-001
4. Multi-language support collaboration (future)

**Outreach Template**:

**Subject**: Partnership Opportunity: AI Governance Standards with Indigenous Data Sovereignty

Dear FNTC Team,

I'm reaching out to introduce the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI), a new non-profit developing regional AI governance standards for Northern BC.

**What We're Doing**

We've just published NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template (v1.0, Draft for Public Comment), an ISO 42001-aligned tool designed for Northern BC organizations. A core principle of NCI is respect for Indigenous sovereignty and data rights, and we're committed to Indigenous-inclusive governance.

**Why We're Reaching Out**

FNTC's work on Indigenous data sovereignty and OCAP® principles aligns directly with NCI's mission. We recognize that Indigenous governments have jurisdiction over AI governance on their territories, and we want to ensure our standards reflect that reality.

**Partnership Opportunity**

We'd like to explore collaboration on:
1. **Co-developing Indigenous Data Sovereignty Protocol** (future NC-AI-006 standard)
2. **Workshops** on AI governance for First Nations governments
3. **FNTC review and endorsement** of NC-AI-001 for Indigenous contexts
4. **Multi-language support** for Indigenous languages in future standards

**Next Steps**

Would you be open to a conversation? I'm happy to:
- Meet in person or via video call
- Share our draft standards for review
- Discuss how we can support FNTC's mission
- Listen to your priorities and concerns

The template is available at: kaizenstrategic.ai/NCI-AI-Governance

Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you.

Respectfully,

### 2. University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC)

**Why Important**: Academic validation, research partnerships, credibility.

**Contact Information**:
- **Provost's Office**: provost@unbc.ca
- **Research Office**: research@unbc.ca
- **Website**: unbc.ca
- **Location**: Prince George, BC
- **AI Researcher**: Dr. Je Sen Teh (cybersecurity AI) - find via unbc.ca

**Current Activities**:

- Courses: "Introduction to Designing AI Applications"
- Ethical AI use guidelines

**Partnership Opportunities**:
1. Academic validation of NC-AI-001
2. Co-publish white papers on AI governance
3. Research partnership (case studies, validation)
4. Student engagement (internships, projects)

**Outreach Template**:

**Subject**: Research Partnership: Regional AI Governance Standards Validation

Dear UNBC Research Team,

I'm writing to introduce the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI), a new non-profit developing regional AI governance standards for Northern BC.

**What We're Doing**

NCI has published NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template, an ISO 42001-aligned framework designed specifically for Northern BC contexts (resource economies, remote communities, small organizations).

**Partnership Opportunity**

We'd like to explore collaboration with UNBC on:
1. **Academic validation** of NC-AI-001 through research
2. **Co-publishing** white papers on AI governance in Northern BC
3. **Research partnership** for case studies and validation
4. **Student engagement** opportunities (internships, projects)

**Why This Matters**

Northern BC has unique AI governance needs (remote communities, resource economies, Indigenous sovereignty) that aren't addressed by generic frameworks. NCI is creating regionally-tailored standards, and academic validation would strengthen credibility.

**Next Steps**

Would UNBC be interested in:
- Reviewing NC-AI-001 for academic validation?
- Co-developing research on regional AI governance?
- Connecting with specific AI researchers for collaboration?

I'm happy to discuss further. The template is available at: kaizenstrategic.ai/NCI-AI-Governance
