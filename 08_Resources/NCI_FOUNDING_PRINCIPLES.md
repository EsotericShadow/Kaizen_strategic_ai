# Northern Cascadia Institute: Founding Principles Declaration
## Draft 0.1 - For Public Comment

**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Draft for Public Comment  
**Jurisdiction:** Northern British Columbia, Canada

## Preamble

The Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance is founded on the principle that Northern British Columbia has the right to articulate its own AI governance standards before external regulation arrives. We believe that AI governance in the North must not be a downstream compliance reaction to standards authored elsewhere—it must be authored here, by the people who live with the consequences.

## Core Principles

### 1. Self-Determination Comes First

Northern communities have the right to articulate their own standards before external regulation arrives. AI governance in the North must not be a downstream compliance reaction to standards authored elsewhere. It must be authored here, by the people that live with the consequences.

### 2. Governance Begins Local

AI will affect daily life, labour patterns, public services, water, land, industry, resource extraction, medical access, education—the things that Northern British Columbia understands differently than Vancouver, Ottawa, or Silicon Valley. We choose to start governance where impact will be felt: on the ground, with our own context.

### 3. Indigenous Nations are Equal Pillars in Standards Creation

Indigenous governments are not stakeholders. They are sovereigns. Standards cannot be legitimate without equal place for Indigenous law, Indigenous data rights, and Indigenous methodologies—at the table, not in the footnotes.

### 4. Northern BC Culture is a Valid Context for AI Risk

AI governance cannot pretend everywhere is the same. The North has its own economic model, its own relationship with land, its own multi-generational industrial cycle. The North is not "edge case Canada." It is a distinct cultural region worthy of its own frameworks.

### 5. The North Must Not Wait for Permission

We do not need to wait for Ottawa or ISO to tell us what is allowed. We begin architecting standards now, and we will interface with ISO, IEEE, provincial, federal, and Indigenous legal systems on our terms.
