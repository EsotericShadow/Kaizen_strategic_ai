# Where to Add Description on GitHub

**The Description field is NOT in Settings → General**

**It's on the MAIN REPOSITORY PAGE** (Code tab)

---

## How to Add Description

1. **Go to your main repository page**:
   - https://github.com/EsotericShadow/nc-ai-templates
   - Make sure you're on the **Code** tab (default tab)

2. **Look on the RIGHT SIDE** of the page
   - You'll see an "About" section
   - It might just show the repository name right now

3. **Click the GEAR ICON** (⚙️) next to the About section
   - Or click "Edit" if you see that button
   - This opens a small popup/edit box

4. **Add Description**:
   - First field: Description
   - Paste: `ISO 42001-aligned AI governance templates for Northern BC / Northern Cascadia. Draft for public comment. Free to use.`

5. **Add Topics** (same popup):
   - Type each topic and press Enter:
     - `ai-governance`
     - `iso-42001`
     - `risk-management`
     - `northern-bc`
     - `templates`
     - `artificial-intelligence`
     - `compliance`

6. **Click "Save"** (button at bottom of popup)

## Visual Guide

```
Repository Page (Code tab)
├── Files (left side)
│
└── About Section (RIGHT SIDE)
    ├── [Gear Icon] ← Click this!
    ├── Repository name
    └── [Edit button]
```

When you click the gear icon, you'll see:
- Description field (top)
- Topics field (below)
- Website field (optional, can skip)
- Save button

## Alternative: If You Don't See "About" Section

If the About section isn't visible:
1. Make sure you're on the Code tab (not Issues, Pull requests, etc.)
2. Try scrolling down a bit (it might be below the file list)
3. It's usually on the right side, near the top

---

**TL;DR**: Go to main repo page → Look right side → Click gear icon on "About" section → Add description and topics there.
