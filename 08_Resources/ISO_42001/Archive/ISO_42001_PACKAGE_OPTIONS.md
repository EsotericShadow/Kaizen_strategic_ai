## Detailed Breakdown

### ISO/IEC 42001 (ALONE) - ✅ YOU NEED THIS

**What it covers:**
- Complete AI management system
- Risk management
- Impact assessments (built in!)
- Governance framework
- All 10 clauses + 42 controls

**Included already:**
- Impact assessment guidance
- Risk assessment procedures
- Third-party management
- Transparency requirements
- Everything for certification

**Price**: CHF 199 (~$280 CAD)

**Recommendation**: **START HERE.** This is all you need for ISO 42001 certification.

### ISO/IEC 42005 (Impact Assessment) - ⚠️ PROBABLY REDUNDANT

**What it adds:**
- More detailed impact assessment guidance
- Structured assessment methodology
- Specific templates for assessments

**Do you need it?**
**Probably NO** if you have ISO 42001 because:
- 42001 already includes impact assessment requirements
- Our workflows cover impact assessments
- Free resources have templates
- Mostly redundant information

**Buy only if**:
- Your auditor specifically requests it
- You need ultra-detailed assessment guidance
- You're doing complex high-risk AI systems

**Price if bundled**: Extra ~$210 CAD

**Recommendation**: **Skip it** unless specifically needed.

---

### ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security) - ⚠️ OPTIONAL

**What it covers:**
- Information security management system
- Data protection frameworks
- Security controls
- Incident response

**Do you need it?**
**Maybe, but not for ISO 42001** because:
- Different certification (info security vs. AI)
- Separate standard, separate certification
- Adds complexity if just pursuing AI cert
- Many requirements overlap

**Buy only if**:
- You want info security certification too
- You need formal security framework
- Your clients require both
- You're handling lots of sensitive data

**Price if bundled**: Extra ~$135 CAD

**Recommendation**: **Skip it** unless pursuing security certification.

---

## Best Strategy

### Phase 1: Start Small ✅
**Buy**: ISO 42001 alone (CHF 199)
**Why**: All you need for AI certification
**Cost**: $280 CAD

### Phase 2: Add If Needed (Later)
**Consider adding**:
- 42005 if auditor requires detailed impact assessments
- 27001 if you want security certification too

**Don't add**:
- Until you know you actually need them
- Just because they're "bundled"
- To save small discount percentages

## The Math

### Option 1: ISO 42001 Alone ✅ BEST CHOICE
- Cost: CHF 199 (~$280 CAD)
- What you get: Everything for AI certification
- Savings: Most money saved

### Option 2: AI Governance Package
- Cost: CHF 351 (~$490 CAD)  
- Extra: CHF 152 (~$210 CAD) for 42005
- Savings: CHF 25 (not worth it)
- **Skip**: 42001 already covers impacts

### Option 3: AI + Security Bundle
- Cost: CHF 298 (~$415 CAD)
- Extra: CHF 99 (~$135 CAD) for 27001
- Savings: CHF 33
- **Skip**: Unless you need security certification

**Winner**: Option 1 (ISO 42001 alone)

## What If You Buy the Bundle?

### Scenario A: You Buy AI Governance Package (CHF 351)
**What happens**:
- You get ISO 42001 ✅
- You get 42005 ✅
- Most of 42005 is redundant with 42001 ❌
- You spent extra $210 for redundancy
- **Not recommended**

### Scenario B: You Buy AI + Security Bundle (CHF 298)
**What happens**:
- You get ISO 42001 ✅
- You get ISO 27001 ✅
- 27001 is separate certification (not AI) ⚠️
- Adds complexity if you don't need it
- **Not recommended** unless you need both

## Real-World Recommendation

### Start Here:
```
Month 1: Buy ISO 42001 alone (CHF 199)
          ↓
Month 2-6: Implement AI management system
          ↓
Month 6: Internal audit
          ↓
Month 7-8: Certification audit with 42001
          ↓
          YOU'RE CERTIFIED ✅
```

### Only Then Consider Adding:
```
After 42001 certification, IF:
- Auditor said "you need more detailed impact assessments" 
  → Consider 42005
  
- You want info security certification too
  → Consider 27001
  
- Clients are asking for additional standards
  → Consider additional standards
```

## The Discount Trap

### Don't Fall For It:

**Bundle Discount**: "Save 6.6%!"  
**Reality**: You're spending $210 extra  
**Save more**: Don't buy it at all

**Bundle Discount**: "Save 10%!"  
**Reality**: You're spending $135 extra  
**Save more**: Buy only what you need

---

## Exception: When the Bundle Makes Sense

### Buy the Bundle If:

**Scenario 1**: You're planning BOTH certifications
- AI certification (42001)
- Info security certification (27001)
- Buy the AI + Security bundle
- Pay once, get both

**Scenario 2**: Large organization
- Dedicated compliance team
- Multiple certifications in plan
- Buying many standards anyway
- Save small amount on package

**Scenario 3**: Auditor specifically requires it
- Your ISO auditor demands 42005
- Check this BEFORE buying
- Most don't require it

---

## For Kaizen (Small Business):

### Recommended:
**Buy**: ISO 42001 alone (CHF 199) ✅

### Skip:
- AI Governance Package (42005 not needed)
- AI + Security Bundle (27001 not needed)

### Reason:
- Small business, limited budget
- Focus on one certification at a time
- ISO 42001 is complete by itself
- Don't pay for redundancy
- Add others only if actually needed

## Decision Tree

```
Do you need ISO 42001? → YES
    ↓
Buy ISO 42001 alone (CHF 199)
    ↓
Certify with 42001
    ↓
Need detailed impact guidance? → YES → Consider 42005
                           NO → Don't buy it
    ↓
Want info security cert too? → YES → Consider 27001
                          NO → Don't buy it
```

---

## Bottom Line

**For your situation** (starting ISO 42001 certification):

✅ **Buy**: ISO 42001 alone (CHF 199 / ~$280 CAD)

❌ **Skip**: Both packages (waste money on redundancy)

**Why**: ISO 42001 is complete by itself. The "extras" in bundles are either redundant or separate certifications you don't need yet.

**Add others later** only if:
- Auditor specifically requires it
- You want additional certifications
- You discover you actually need them

**Don't buy bundles** just because they're "discounted" if you don't need everything in them.

## Quick Reference

| Standard | Cost | You Need? | Why/Why Not |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **ISO 42001** | CHF 199 | ✅ YES | Complete AI certification |
| ISO 42005 | +CHF 177 | ❌ NO | Redundant with 42001 |
| ISO 27001 | +CHF 99 | ❌ NO | Different certification |
| **42001 + 42005** | CHF 351 | ❌ NO | Paying for redundancy |
| **42001 + 27001** | CHF 298 | ⚠️ MAYBE | Only if you need both certs |

**Your choice**: ISO 42001 alone ✅

**Final answer**: Buy ISO 42001 alone. Skip the bundles unless you actually need the additional standards for separate certifications.
