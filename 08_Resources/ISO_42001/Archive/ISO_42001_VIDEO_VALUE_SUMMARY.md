# ISO 42001 Video Source Value Summary

## Honest Assessment: Which Videos Gave Unique Value?

### HIGH VALUE - Unique insights
**Source 1 (Risk 360)**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **6 months implementation, 12 months certification** (specific timeline)
- **1-2 weeks core work** (managing effort expectations)
- **Engineering hardest part, not paperwork** (critical insight)
- Real-world example: Alternative credit scoring mortgage company
- AI Impact Assessment vs Risk Assessment distinction (key concept)

**Source 5 (Ministry of Security)**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Practical documents**: Context register, scope, SoA, objectives (Excel-friendly)

### LOW VALUE - Mostly marketing/general info
**Source 7 (LRQA)**: ⭐
