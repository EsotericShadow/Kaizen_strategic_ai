# ISO 42001 - Your Action Plan

## Based on Real-World Insights

Based on comprehensive analysis of seven expert sources:
1. Risk 360 (implementation reality)
2. Structure Tutorial (conceptual framework)
3. Standards Australia (ecosystem & compliance)
4. Certified Info Sec (training prerequisites)
5. Ministry of Security (practical implementation walkthrough)
6. Interser (lead auditor training, bias/ethics)
7. LRQA (business case & certification value)

## Priority Actions

### 1. ✅ VALIDATED: ISO 42001 is THE Standard

**The evidence**:
- Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Anthropic all certified
- Microsoft requiring vendors to get certified
- Only AI certification available
- Fastest growing AI certification globally

**Your decision**: YES, pursue this. It's the de facto standard.

---

### 2. ⚠️ REALITY CHECK: 6 Months Implementation

**From webinar**: "Most companies want to get this done within a calendar year. It's about 6 months to do an implementation."

**Your timeline**:
- 6 months implementation
- + 6 months certification
- = 12 months total

**Your revenue-first strategy**: Perfect. Build revenue Years 1-2, then certify Years 2-3.

---

### 3. 🎯 KEY DIFFERENCE: AI Impact Assessment

**From webinar**: This is the unique concept that differentiates ISO 42001 from ISO 27001.

**What it is**:
- Not risk assessment (that's separate)
- Asks: "How could this AI harm individuals/groups?"
- Must document mitigations

**Real example**:
- Lending company discovered bias in credit scoring data
- Built transparency tools + bias detection
- Actual business value, not just compliance

**Your takeaway**: This is the hardest part conceptually. The rest is similar to ISO 27001.

---

### 4. 💰 COST REALITY: Standard + Certification

**From research**:
- Standard: $280 CAD
- Certification: $20K-$40K (typical)
- Insurance: $4K/year
- Total Year 1: ~$25K-$45K

**From webinar**: Most companies do 6 months implementation work themselves plus hire consultants.

**Your decision**: 
- Buy standard when ready
- Plan for certification Years 2-3 (revenue-funded)

---

### 5. 🚀 SCOPE: Product vs Company

**From webinar**: Scope depends on your use case.

**For Kaizen**:
- **Years 1-2**: Company scope (your AI use)
- **Years 3+**: Potentially product scope (data center services)

**Key question**: What risk are you managing? Which stakeholders need assurance?

**Your answer**: Northern BC businesses trusting your AI consulting.

---

### 6. 📋 THE 38 CONTROLS

**From webinar**: Need to cover all 38 controls with evidence.

**Major categories**:
- Policies
- Risk management  
- Impact assessment (unique!)
- SDLC integration
- Data quality/bias
- Transparency
- Third-party AI management

**Your approach**: Use simple workflows document. Start documenting as you work.

---

### 7. 🎓 EFFORT BY TEAM

**From webinar**:
- Leadership: 1-2 hours total
- GRC/Security: 1-2 weeks effort
- Product/Engineering: 1 day + evidence
- Legal: Half day

**For Kaizen (solo)**:
- You = All of the above
- Manageable since small company
- Document as you work, not separate workstream

---

### 8. ⚠️ ENGINEERING INTEGRATION = HARDEST PART

**From webinar**: "The hardest part is engineering integration, not the paperwork."

**Why**:
- Context dependent
- No universal best practices yet
- Requires AI expertise

**Your advantage**: You ARE the AI expert. This is your strength, not weakness.

**Examples from webinar**:
- Which model for which use case?
- Data governance and quality
- Agent identity/access management
- Bias detection systems

**Your approach**: Your workflows are already covering this.

---

### 9. 📊 CERTIFICATION PROCESS

**From webinar**:

**Stage 1** (Design review):
- 1-2 days
- Look at 20-25 artifacts
- Decides if ready for Stage 2

**30-45 days break**

**Stage 2** (Full audit):
- 1-2 days
- Look at 75-100 artifacts
- Decision: Certify or fix issues

**30 days later**: Certification issued

**Then**: Annual surveillance audits

**Your timeline**: Plan for 8-10 month certification process after implementation.

---

### 10. 💡 GOVERNANCE: Keep It High-Value

**From webinar**: Don't waste leadership time with boring meetings.

**What works**:
- Quarterly high-impact sessions
- Effective prep/read-aheads
- Async communication (Slack)
- Decision-focused, never boring

**For Kaizen**: You're solo, so this is simple. Quarterly reviews with yourself, document decisions.

---
