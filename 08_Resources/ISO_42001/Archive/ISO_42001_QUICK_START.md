A: 3 years, with annual surveillance audits. Full re-certification every 3 years.

**Q: What happens if I fail an audit?**  
A: You get nonconformities to address. Critical findings must be fixed before certification. Minor findings can be fixed later.

**Q: Do I need all procedures from day 1?**  
A: No, but you need them implemented before certification audit. Start with high-priority procedures.

**Q: Can I become certified if I'm a solo founder?**
