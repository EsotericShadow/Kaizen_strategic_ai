# Which ISO Standards Does Kaizen Actually Need?

## Your Business Context

**What you do**:
- AI consulting for Northern BC businesses
- Custom AI solutions and automation
- Process optimization and digital strategy
- Client data handling (business info, some personal data)
- Web development and system integration
- Third-party AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, API services)

**Clients**: Small to medium businesses (5-50 employees)
**Data handled**: Client business data, some personal information, operational data
**Security**: VPN, encryption, backups, cyber liability insurance

---

## The Three Standards

### ISO 42001 - AI Management ✅ NEED THIS
**What it covers**: AI governance, responsible AI, AI risk management

**Kaizen needs this because**:
- You provide AI consulting services
- You develop custom AI solutions
- You use multiple third-party AI tools
- Competitive differentiation in Northern BC
- Future regulatory readiness
- Client trust and credibility

**Decision**: **YES, BUY THIS**

---

### ISO 42005 - AI Impact Assessment ⚠️ PROBABLY REDUNDANT
**What it covers**: Detailed AI impact assessment methodology

**Kaizen might need this if**:
- Auditor specifically requires more detailed impact assessments
- You're doing high-risk AI systems
- You want very thorough impact documentation

**But wait**: ISO 42001 already includes impact assessment requirements!

**Decision**: **PROBABLY SKIP** (unless auditor asks for it)

---

### ISO 27001 - Information Security ⚠️ MAYBE, BUT NOT NOW
**What it covers**: Information security management system

**Kaizen might need this if**:
- Clients specifically request it
- You handle lots of highly sensitive data
- You want security certification
- Enterprise clients require it

**Current situation**:
- You have basic security (VPN, encryption, backups)
- Cyber liability insurance covers you
- Small business, not handling medical/financial data extensively
- Clients are local small businesses

**Decision**: **NOT NOW** (revisit when you have enterprise clients)

---

## Recommended Purchase Decision

### For Kaizen Right Now:

**Buy**: ISO 42001 alone (CHF 199 / ~$280 CAD)

**Skip**: 
- ISO 42005 (redundant with 42001)
- ISO 27001 (not needed yet)

**Why**:
- AI governance is your core differentiator
- ISO 42001 is complete by itself
- Don't pay for redundancy
- Security standards can wait

---

## The "Bundle Question" for Kaizen

### Option 1: ISO 42001 Alone ✅ BEST CHOICE
**Price**: CHF 199 (~$280 CAD)
**What you get**: Complete AI certification
**Your situation**: AI is your focus, this is all you need

**Recommendation**: **Buy this**

---

### Option 2: AI Governance Bundle (42001 + 42005)
**Price**: CHF 351 (~$490 CAD)
**Extra cost**: CHF 152 (~$210 CAD)

**Do you need it?**: **NO**
- 42001 already covers impact assessments
- Paying $210 for redundancy
- Not worth it for small business

**Recommendation**: **Skip it**

---

### Option 3: AI + Security Bundle (42001 + 27001)
**Price**: CHF 298 (~$415 CAD)
**Extra cost**: CHF 99 (~$135 CAD)

**Do you need it?**: **MAYBE LATER**
- Security certification could be valuable
- But not needed now
- Add when you have enterprise clients or requirements
- Two separate certifications anyway

**Recommendation**: **Skip it for now**

---

## When Would You Need the Other Standards?

### ISO 42005 (Impact Assessment)
**Add if**:
- Your ISO 42001 auditor specifically requests it
- You're doing high-risk AI systems
- You discover you need more detailed guidance

**When**: After you start 42001 certification, if auditor says you need it

---

### ISO 27001 (Information Security)
**Add if**:
- Large/enterprise client requires it
- You start handling medical/financial data extensively
- You want to offer "security certified" as a differentiator
- Regulatory requirements change

**When**: When you have enterprise clients or get specific requests

---

## Real-World Recommendation for Kaizen

### Phase 1 (Now): Buy ISO 42001 Alone
**Action**: Purchase ISO 42001 (CHF 199)
**Why**: AI is your core differentiator, all you need for AI cert
**Timeline**: 6-8 months to certification

**After certification**: You're "ISO 42001 Certified AI Consulting"

---

### Phase 2 (Later, If Needed): Add Standards
**ISO 42005**: Add only if auditor specifically requires it
**ISO 27001**: Add when enterprise clients request it or you need security cert

**Approach**: Buy additional standards only when you need them

---

## The Bundles vs. Buying Separately

### If You Buy Everything Eventually:

**Buy separately**:
- 42001: CHF 199
- 42005: CHF 177
- 27001: CHF 132
- **Total**: CHF 508

**Buy bundles**:
- AI Governance Bundle: CHF 351 (42001 + 42005)
- Buy 27001 separate: CHF 132
- **Total**: CHF 483

**Savings**: CHF 25 (less than $5 CAD)

**Conclusion**: Bundles barely save money. Buy only what you need, when you need it.

## Your Specific Situation Analysis

### What Clients Care About:
**Right now** (small businesses in Northern BC):
- Can you help with AI? ✅ (ISO 42001)
- Are you trustworthy? ✅ (ISO 42001)
- Do you know what you're doing? ✅ (ISO 42001)
- Do you have ISO 27001? ❌ (probably don't ask)

**Later** (enterprise/large clients):
- ISO 42001 certification? ✅
- ISO 27001 certification? ⚠️ Maybe they ask
- ISO 42005? ❌ (not a thing)

**Reality**: Northern BC small businesses don't ask about security certifications yet.

---

## Final Recommendation for Kaizen

### What to Buy:
**ISO 42001 alone** (CHF 199 / ~$280 CAD)

### What to Skip:
- AI Governance Bundle (paying for redundancy)
- AI + Security Bundle (not needed yet)

### Why:
1. **AI is your differentiator** - 42001 is the certification that matters
2. **Complete by itself** - Has everything for AI certification
3. **Budget-friendly** - Save $210-$135 vs. bundles
4. **Future flexibility** - Add other standards later if needed
5. **Your clients** - Don't need security cert right now

### Add Later If:
- Auditor asks for 42005 → Buy it then
- Enterprise client needs 27001 → Buy it then
- Regulatory changes → Buy what's required

---

## Action Plan

**Now**:
1. Buy ISO 42001 alone from ISO.org (CHF 199)
2. Use free resources to start implementing
3. Begin certification journey

**Month 6** (if auditor says):
- "You need more detailed impact assessments" → Buy 42005

**Year 2** (if growing):
- Enterprise clients ask for security cert → Buy 27001
- Revisit whether you need additional standards

---

## Bottom Line

**For Kaizen**: Buy ISO 42001 alone. That's it.

The bundles are marketing. You don't need redundancy now, and you don't need security certification for small business clients yet.

**Start with 42001. Add others later if you actually need them.**
