## RISK ASSESSMENT CHEAT SHEET

For each AI use, ask:

```
□ Uses personal data? → Document privacy controls
□ Makes business decisions? → Add human review
□ Could cause financial loss? → Extra testing
□ Could harm people? → Senior approval required
□ Client unfamiliar with AI? → Education session
```

**That's it.** 5 questions. Done.

---

## DECISION TIME

**By the end of Month 1, decide:**

- [ ] **Option A**: Full certification (8 months, $20K-$40K)
  - Strongest marketing
  - Best differentiation
  - Most credibility

- [ ] **Option B**: Build system but hold on certification (3 months, $500)
  - Use "working toward ISO 42001" in marketing
  - Build foundation for later
  - Lower cost entry

- [ ] **Option C**: Skip certification, just follow best practices
  - No cost
  - No audit
  - Still responsible AI

**Any option is fine.** Choose what fits your business.

## FINAL WORDS

**This checklist is all you need.**

Don't overcomplicate it.

Do one phase at a time.

Check things off.

Keep it simple.

**Start with Month 1, Week 1. Go.**
