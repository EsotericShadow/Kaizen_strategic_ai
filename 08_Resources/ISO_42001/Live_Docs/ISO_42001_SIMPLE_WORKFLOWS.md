# ISO 42001 - Simple Workflows & Processes

## The Simple Truth
You're already doing good AI work. ISO 42001 just asks you to **document it and do it consistently**.

## WORKFLOW 1: New AI Project? Follow This

```
START: New AI Project
    ↓
STEP 1: Fill out AI System Inventory
    ↓
STEP 2: Assess Risks (5 minutes)
    - Can it cause harm? → Document risk
    - Does it use personal data? → Document risk
    - Could it be biased? → Document risk
    ↓
STEP 3: Create Impact Assessment (if high risk)
    - Who's affected?
    - What could go wrong?
    - How do we prevent it?
    ↓
STEP 4: Build with safeguards
    - Human review checkpoints
    - Testing before launch
    - Client approval
    ↓
STEP 5: Document it all
    - Save in project folder
    - Record in AI Systems List
    ↓
END: Launch with confidence
```

## WORKFLOW 2: Using AI Tools Daily

```
Every time you use AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot):
    ↓
1. Is client data involved? 
    ↓ YES → Secure handling, client approval
    ↓ NO  → Continue
    ↓
2. Is this a decision clients will act on?
    ↓ YES → Human review required
    ↓ NO  → Continue
    ↓
3. Save the prompts/work in project folder
    ↓
DONE
```

**That's it.** No paperwork. Just think before you act.

## DECISION TREES

### Decision Tree: Is This Risky?

```
START: New AI use case
    ↓
Uses personal data?
    ↓ YES → MEDIUM RISK
    ↓ NO  → Continue
    ↓
Makes important business decisions?
    ↓ YES → MEDIUM RISK

    ↓
Could cause financial loss if wrong?
    ↓ YES → HIGH RISK
    ↓ NO  → Continue
    ↓
Could harm people if wrong?
    ↓ YES → CRITICAL RISK
    ↓ NO  → LOW RISK
```

**Actions by Risk Level:**
- **LOW**: Use it, document it
- **MEDIUM**: Human review, extra testing
- **HIGH**: Impact assessment, safeguards, client sign-off
- **CRITICAL**: Senior review, extensive testing, backup plans

### Decision Tree: Do I Need Documentation?

```
START: New AI activity
    ↓
Is this a client deliverable?
    ↓ YES → Full documentation
    ↓ NO  → Continue
    ↓
Have I done this before?
    ↓ YES → Brief note
    ↓ NO  → Document process
    ↓
Could client ask about this later?
    ↓ YES → Document
    ↓ NO  → Skip if low risk

## TRUTH BOMB: What Auditors Actually Care About

**They DON'T care about**:
- 500-page manuals
- Perfect grammar
- Complex procedures

**They DO care about**:
1. You thought about risks
2. You took reasonable precautions
3. You documented your decisions
4. You fixed problems when they happened
5. You try to improve

**That's it.**

## WHAT TO STOP WASTING TIME ON

❌ **Don't**: Write 100-page procedures  
✅ **Do**: One-page checklists  

❌ **Don't**: Create complex workflows  
✅ **Do**: Simple decision trees  

❌ **Don't**: Perfect documentation  
✅ **Do**: Good enough to prove you thought about it  

❌ **Don't**: Over-engineer everything  
✅ **Do**: What actually makes sense

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**ISO 42001 is asking you to prove you're not an idiot with AI.**

Show them:
1. You think before using AI
2. You test your stuff
3. You fix problems
4. You learn from mistakes

**That's the whole standard.** Everything else is just proving you do those things.
