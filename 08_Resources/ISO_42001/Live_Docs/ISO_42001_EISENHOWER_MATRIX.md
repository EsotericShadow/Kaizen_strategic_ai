## EISENHOWER MATRIX

### 🔴 URGENT + IMPORTANT (Do First)
**Critical for starting ISO 42001 implementation**

1. **Buy ISO 42001 Standard** ($280 CAD)
   - Blocking: Can't properly implement without it
   - Timeline: Week 1
   - Effort: 1 hour (buy + download)
   - Status: ❌ Missing

2. **Write AI Policy** (1 page)
   - Blocking: Foundation for everything else
   - Timeline: Week 2
   - Effort: 2-4 hours
   - Status: ❌ Missing

3. **AI Systems Inventory** (simple list)
   - Blocking: Need to know what you're managing
   - Timeline: Week 2
   - Effort: 1 hour
   - Status: ⚠️ Partially there (know tools, not documented)

4. **Define Scope**
   - Blocking: Need clarity on what's being certified
   - Timeline: Week 2
   - Effort: 1 hour
   - Status: ❌ Missing

---

### 🟡 IMPORTANT + NOT URGENT (Schedule This)
**Critical for certification, but can wait months**

5. **Implement Risk Assessment Process**
   - Timeline: Month 2
   - Effort: 2-3 days
   - Status: ⚠️ Partially there (some informal)
   - When: After policy & inventory

6. **Implement Impact Assessment Process** ⭐
   - Timeline: Month 2
   - Effort: 3-4 days (this is the new concept)
   - Status: ❌ Missing
   - When: After risk assessment

7. **Create Simple Procedures**
   - Timeline: Month 2-3
   - Effort: 1-2 days per procedure
   - Status: ⚠️ Partially there
   - When: After assessments

8. **Set Up Internal Audit Program**
   - Timeline: Month 3-4
   - Effort: 1 day setup + 1 day first audit
   - Status: ❌ Missing
   - When: After procedures in place

9. **Create Statement of Applicability**
   - Timeline: Month 3
   - Effort: 2-3 hours
   - Status: ❌ Missing
   - When: After reading standard

10. **Build Evidence Over Time**
    - Timeline: Months 2-5
    - Effort: Ongoing
    - Status: ⚠️ Missing
    - When: Actually use procedures

11. **Choose Certification Body**
    - Timeline: Month 6
    - Effort: 1 day research + calls
    - Status: ❌ Missing
    - When: Before Stage 1 audit

---

### 🟢 URGENT + NOT IMPORTANT (Delegate/Limit)
**Things that come up but distract from ISO work**

12. **Requests for new AI tool demos**
    - Delegate: Set aside dedicated time weekly
    - Don't let these block ISO implementation
    - Status: ✅ Part of business as usual

13. **Client emergencies**
    - Delegate: Use existing crisis procedures
    - Don't let these delay ISO documentation
    - Status: ✅ Part of business as usual

---

### ⚪ NOT URGENT + NOT IMPORTANT (Eliminate)
**Don't bother with these yet**

14. **Watch more videos** ❌
    - You have 9 videos transcribed already
    - More info won't help implementation

15. **Research certification bodies in detail** ❌
    - Too early - do this in Month 6
    - Not needed now

16. **Read every free resource** ❌
    - You have enough
    - Action > information

17. **Compare ISO 42005/27001** ❌
    - Decision made: Just get 42001
    - Not needed
