# ISO 42001 - Key Takeaways from 9 Video Transcripts

## THE BIGGEST INSIGHT: You Need ISO 42001 ✅

**Why**: It's the ONLY AI certification standard  
**Who else has it**: Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Anthropic  
**What Microsoft does**: Requires vendors in SSPA program to get it  
**Your decision**: Yes, get it

---

## TIMELINE REALITY

**Implementation**: 6 months  
**Certification**: +6 months  
**Total**: 12 months to certified

**Effort by team**:
- Leadership: 1-2 hours total
- GRC/Risk: 1-2 weeks (most work)
- Engineering: 1 day + evidence gathering
- Legal: Half day

**Bottom line**: Manageable if organized.

---

## KEY DIFFERENCE: AI Impact Assessment

**This is the new thing** that doesn't exist in ISO 27001:

**Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong with AI?  
**Impact Assessment**: How could AI harm people?

**Real example**: Lending company found bias in credit scoring → built transparency tools + bias detection

**Both required** by ISO 42001.

---

## THE HARDEST PART

**NOT paperwork** ❌  
**IS engineering integration** ✅

Why?
- Context dependent (ChatGPT vs custom LLM vs orchestration)
- No universal best practices yet
- Requires AI expertise, not just compliance

**Reality**: This is where actual work happens.

---

## SCOPE STRATEGY

**You can scope very narrow**:
- Example: 500 employees, 6 people on AI phone system
- Scope: Just that phone system application
- Saves: Time and money on certification

**Four roles affect audit days**:
- Developer
- Provider
- User  
- Multiple

**No discounts**: Only additions allowed (unlike MD5 which allows 30% reductions)

---

## CERTIFICATION MECHANICS

**Stage 1**: Design review (1-2 days, 20-25 artifacts)  
**Stage 2**: Full audit (30-45 days later, 75-100 artifacts)  
**Surveillance**: Year 2-3, ~1/3 of controls  
**Recertification**: Year 4, start over

**Remote audits**: Work fine, just like ISO 27001

**Auditor shortage**: Real problem right now - zero applicants after 2 months of marketing  
**Hybrid approach**: Technical experts + ISO Auditors working together

---

## PRIVACY & CONSENT REALITY

**PII in AI context**:
- Not just medical data
- Includes ALL browsing behavior
- What you search = PII when combined with identity

**Consent**: 99% mandatory (made so for legal defense)  
**May not be fair**: But that's the reality  
**Privacy workaround**: Take data without identifying individuals (enough data points = can still identify)

---

## BIAS vs ETHICS

**Different concepts**:
- **Bias**: Always bad (favoring someone unfairly)
- **Ethics**: Contextual (may be correct for certain scenario)

**Examples**:
- Medical AI only recommending one medicine = bias
- Cultural adaptation for region = ethics

**Both need management**: But understanding difference matters

---

## MARKET EXPLOSION COMING

**Prediction**: Will surpass ISO 27001 growth "very quickly"  
**Currently**: Fastest growing AI certification globally  
**ANAB**: Already got 4 applications, expecting 20-25 by end of 2024  
**New players**: AI companies want to become certification bodies  
**All industries**: Healthcare, finance, automotive, aerospace, marketing, call centers

**Your opportunity**: Get ahead of the curve.

---

## AI WILL IMPACT CERT PROCESS

**Already happening**: One AB in Asia using AI to write audit reports  
**Within 2-3 years**: Common  
**Workgroups started**: IAF and ITIC looking at AI use in certification

**Uses**:
- Writing non-conformities (more consistent)
- Developing audit plans
- Assisting in process

**Reality**: AI auditing AI governance is coming.

---

## CANADIAN PILOT

**When**: Last summer  
**Who**: Banking institution  
**Results**: Fed back to workgroup, influenced DISC → FDIS changes

**Lesson**: Real-world audits happening and improving the standard

---

## TRAINING & COMPETENCY

**Required**: 
- Information security experience
- Two years AI experience
- Three-day training course
- Lead Auditor: 3 audits (chicken/egg problem!)

**Available training**: Very limited right now  
**Timeline**: 6-12 months before Exemplar Global and IEA add programs  
**Sources**: Universities, industry contracts, AB/CB websites

**Reality**: Everyone playing catch-up because standard published early.

---

## BOTTOM LINE FOR KAIZEN

1. **Buy ISO 42001**: Just that one ($280 CAD)
2. **Timeline**: 6 months implementation + 6 months certification
3. **Focus**: Engineering integration is hardest part
4. **Scope**: Can be narrow to save money
5. **Unique piece**: AI Impact Assessment (not just risk)
6. **Market**: Exploding - get ahead
7. **Privacy**: More complex than it appears
8. **Cert process**: Remote works, auditor shortage real
9. **AI audits AI**: Coming within 2-3 years

**Most valuable documents**: Your workflows, checklist, and insights doc  
**Best practical advice**: Scope to single application to save money  
**Biggest unique concept**: AI Impact Assessment vs Risk Assessment
