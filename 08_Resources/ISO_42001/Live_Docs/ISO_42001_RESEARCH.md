## Can You Get It for Free?

### Short Answer: No (legally)

ISO standards are **copyrighted** and **proprietary**. The full official standard is **NOT available free** through:
- ❌ GitHub
- ❌ Internet Archive
- ❌ Library of Congress
- ❌ University libraries
- ❌ Government databases
- ❌ Any legal channel

### Why Not Free?
- ISO funds itself through standard sales
- Copyright protection (international)
- No legal free distribution
- New standard (Dec 2023) = no leak yet

### If You Find a PDF Online
- Likely **illegal/unauthorized** copy
- May be **outdated or incorrect**
- Could **violate copyright** laws
- **Not trustworthy** for certification
