## Email Template

Dear Ms. Famulak (or appropriate contact),

I'm writing to introduce the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI) and explore potential collaboration with BC Chamber of Commerce.

**About NCI**

I've initiated NCI as a non-profit developing regional AI governance standards specifically for Northern BC. We've published **NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template**, a free, ISO 42001-aligned tool designed for organizations implementing AI systems.

**Alignment with BC Chamber**

I noticed BC Chamber is pushing for public sector AI framework and published "Accelerating AI Adoption in BC" (2025). NCI's work aligns with Chamber's goals of supporting businesses with AI governance tools and resources.

**What NCI Offers BC Chamber Members**

- **Free Tools**: NC-AI-001 template (PDF, Word, CSV, Markdown)
- **Northern BC Perspective**: Regional expertise on AI governance
- **Practical Frameworks**: Not just principles, but templates businesses can use
- **ISO-Aligned**: Meets international standards for credibility

**Partnership Opportunities**

I'd like to explore:

1. **Resource Sharing**: NCI standards as BC Chamber resource for members
2. **Policy Input**: NCI providing Northern BC perspective on AI governance policy
3. **Business Network**: Collaboration on business-focused AI governance guides
4. **Events**: Speaking opportunities at Chamber events

**Next Steps**

Would BC Chamber be interested in:

- **Reviewing NC-AI-001** as a resource for members?
- **Resource sharing** agreement?
- **Policy collaboration** opportunities?
- **Discussion** on partnership?

**The Template**

NC-AI-001 is available at: kaizenstrategic.ai/NCI-AI-Governance

**Thank You**

Best regards,
