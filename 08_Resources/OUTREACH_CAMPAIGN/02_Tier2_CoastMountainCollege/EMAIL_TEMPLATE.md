## Email Template

Dear Dr. Waye (or appropriate contact),

I'm writing to introduce the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI) and explore potential educational partnerships with Coast Mountain College.

**About NCI**

I've initiated NCI as a non-profit developing regional AI governance standards specifically for Northern BC. We've published **NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template**, a free, ISO 42001-aligned tool designed for organizations implementing AI systems.

**Why CMTN Partnership Matters**

Both CMTN and NCI serve Northern BC communities. As organizations adopt AI systems, they need practical governance tools and training - something CMTN could help provide through education and workshops.

**Partnership Opportunities**

I'd like to explore collaboration on:

1. **Workshop Hosting**: Host AI governance workshops at CMTN campuses (Terrace, Kitimat, Prince Rupert, Smithers) for businesses and organizations
2. **Training Programs**: Develop training curriculum using NC-AI-001 as foundation
3. **Community Education Hub**: CMTN as central location for AI governance education in Northern BC
4. **Student Engagement**: Opportunities for students (projects, internships, research)

**What We Offer**

- **Free Workshops**: No cost to CMTN or participants
- **Training Curriculum**: Ready-to-use materials
- **Educational Resources**: Templates, guides, case studies
- **Expertise**: AI governance knowledge and ISO 42001 alignment

**Local Connection**

Both NCI and CMTN are Terrace-based, making collaboration natural and convenient. We could work together to build Northern BC's AI governance capacity.

**Next Steps**

Would CMTN be interested in:

- **Hosting a workshop** on AI governance?
- **Developing a training program** together?
- **Partnership discussion** to explore opportunities?
- **Meeting** to discuss further?

I'm happy to:
- Meet in person (Terrace) or via video call
- Provide workshop proposal
- Share training curriculum ideas
- Listen to CMTN's priorities

**The Template**

NC-AI-001 is available at: kaizenstrategic.ai/NCI-AI-Governance

**Thank You**

Thank you for CMTN's important work educating Northern BC. I look forward to the possibility of collaboration.

Best regards,
