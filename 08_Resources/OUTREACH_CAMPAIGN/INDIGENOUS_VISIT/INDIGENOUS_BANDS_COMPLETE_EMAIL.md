Dear [Chief Name] and [Band Name] Council,

I'm writing to introduce the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI) and to request the opportunity to visit [Band Name] on **[VISIT DATE]** to discuss a potential partnership opportunity.

**About NCI**

I've initiated NCI as a non-profit developing regional AI governance standards specifically for Northern BC (north of Prince George). We've just published **NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template**, a free, ISO 42001-aligned tool for organizations implementing AI systems.

**Core Commitment: Indigenous Data Sovereignty**

A foundational principle of NCI is respect for Indigenous sovereignty and data rights. We recognize that:
- Indigenous governments have jurisdiction over AI governance on their territories
- Data sovereignty is critical (aligned with OCAP® principles)
- Indigenous perspectives must inform standards development
- Partnership with Indigenous organizations is essential, not optional

**What We're Offering**

1. **Free Tools**: NC-AI-001 template (PDF, Word, CSV) - completely free, no cost
2. **Partnership Opportunity**: Co-develop Indigenous data sovereignty standards (NC-AI-006)
3. **Collaboration**: Work together on AI governance frameworks that respect sovereignty
4. **Support**: Resources and training for Indigenous organizations

**What We're Seeking**

1. **Input**: Feedback on NC-AI-001 from Indigenous data sovereignty perspective
2. **Partnership**: Collaboration on Indigenous-inclusive standards development
3. **Co-Development**: Work together on NC-AI-006 (Indigenous Data Sovereignty Protocol)
4. **Guidance**: Learn from [Band Name]'s priorities, concerns, and needs

**Visit Details**

**Date**: **[VISIT DATE - e.g., Monday, November 18, 2025]**  
**Time**: **10:00 AM - 12:00 PM** (or at your convenience - I'm flexible)  
**Duration**: 1-2 hours (your preference)  
**Location**: [Band Office] or your preferred location  
**Purpose**: Partnership discussion, information sharing, and listening to your priorities

**What We'll Discuss**

1. **NCI Introduction**: Who we are, what we're doing, why Northern BC
2. **NC-AI-001 Overview**: The free template we've created (28 AI risks, ISO-aligned)
3. **Partnership Opportunities**: How we can collaborate on AI governance
4. **Your Priorities**: What [Band Name] needs from AI governance frameworks
5. **Data Sovereignty**: How NCI standards can respect and support Indigenous data sovereignty
6. **Co-Development**: Working together on Indigenous-specific standards (NC-AI-006)

**What We'll Bring**

- NC-AI-001 template (printed copies for your review)
- Information package (detailed materials)
- Partnership proposal (if interested)
- Respect, willingness to listen, and collaborative approach

**Information Package Included**

This email includes attachments with:

2. **NC-AI-001 Template**: The complete risk register template (PDF)
3. **Partnership Proposal**: How we can work together (2 pages)
4. **Indigenous Data Sovereignty Commitment**: Our approach and principles (1 page)

**Next Steps**

If **[VISIT DATE]** works for you, I'd be grateful for:
- Confirmation of availability
- Preferred time (I'm flexible - morning, afternoon, or evening)
- Any questions before the visit
- Alternative date if **[VISIT DATE]** doesn't work (I can accommodate)

If you'd prefer to discuss by phone first, I'm happy to call. You can reach me at **[Your Phone]** or email governance@kaizenstrategic.ai.

If in-person isn't possible or preferred, I'm happy to arrange a video call at your convenience. The same information package applies.
