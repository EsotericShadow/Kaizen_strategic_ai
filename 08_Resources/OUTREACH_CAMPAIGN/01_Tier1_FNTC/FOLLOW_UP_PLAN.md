# FNTC Follow-Up Plan

**Organization**: First Nations Technology Council  
**Priority**: CRITICAL

## Follow-Up Sequence

### If NO Response After Initial Email (Week 4)

#### Follow-Up Email #1 (7 days after initial)

**Subject**: Re: Partnership Opportunity - Northern Cascadia Institute

**Message**:

Hi FNTC Team,

I wanted to follow up on my email from last week about the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance and potential partnership opportunities.

I understand FNTC receives many inquiries. If this isn't a priority right now, I completely understand. If helpful, I'm happy to:

- Share our draft standard (NC-AI-001) for your review when convenient
- Provide more information about NCI's commitment to Indigenous data sovereignty
- Connect at a future time if that's better

If there's a better contact person for this type of inquiry, I'd appreciate being pointed in their direction.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Gabriel Lacroix

### If STILL No Response (Week 5)

#### Follow-Up Email #2 (14 days after initial)

**Subject**: Brief Update: NC-AI-001 Published, Seeking Indigenous Feedback

**Message**:

Hi FNTC Team,

Quick update: We've published NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template as Draft for Public Comment, and it's live at kaizenstrategic.ai/NCI-AI-Governance

I'm particularly seeking feedback from Indigenous organizations on how the template addresses (or doesn't address) Indigenous data sovereignty considerations. FNTC's expertise would be invaluable.

If this isn't something FNTC can engage with right now, I understand completely. If you'd like to connect in the future, I'm here.

Thank you for FNTC's important work.

Best,
Gabriel Lacroix

### Alternative Approach: Attend FNTC Events

- [ ] Network in person
- [ ] Mention NCI organically in conversations

### If POSITIVE Response Received

#### Response to Positive Interest

**Thank You Email**:

Thank you so much for your interest! I'm excited about the possibility of collaborating.

[Customize based on what they're interested in]

Would you prefer to:
- Schedule a call to discuss partnership opportunities?
- Review NC-AI-001 first and provide feedback?
- Meet in person (I can come to Vancouver or we can meet virtually)?

I'm flexible and happy to work around your schedule.

Looking forward to continuing the conversation.

Best,
Gabriel

**Stop Following Up If**:

3. **Persistence**: Multiple touchpoints may be needed
4. **Flexibility**: Adjust approach based on feedback
5. **Value**: Focus on what we can offer, not just what we need
