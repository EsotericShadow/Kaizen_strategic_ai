## Email Template

Dear FNTC Team,

I'm writing to introduce the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI) and explore potential partnership opportunities aligned with FNTC's work on Indigenous data sovereignty and technology advancement.

**About NCI**

I've initiated NCI as a non-profit developing regional AI governance standards specifically for Northern BC (north of Prince George). We've just published our first standard, **NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template** (v1.0, Draft for Public Comment), an ISO 42001-aligned tool designed for organizations implementing AI systems.

**Core Principle: Indigenous Sovereignty**

A foundational principle of NCI is respect for Indigenous sovereignty and data rights. We recognize that:
- Indigenous governments have jurisdiction over AI governance on their territories
- Data sovereignty is critical (aligned with OCAP® principles)
- Indigenous perspectives must inform standards development
- Partnership with Indigenous organizations is essential, not optional

**Why I'm Reaching Out**

FNTC's leadership in Indigenous technology and data sovereignty aligns directly with NCI's mission. Your work on OCAP® principles, AI needs surveys, and data sovereignty frameworks is exactly what NCI standards must reflect.

**Partnership Opportunities**

I'd like to explore collaboration on:

1. **Co-development of Indigenous Data Sovereignty Protocol**: A future standard (NC-AI-006) that would integrate OCAP® principles into AI governance frameworks, developed in partnership with FNTC.

2. **Review and Feedback on NC-AI-001**: We'd value FNTC's review of our current template to ensure it appropriately considers Indigenous contexts and data sovereignty.

3. **Joint Workshops**: Collaborative workshops on AI governance for First Nations governments, combining FNTC's Indigenous expertise with NCI's practical tools.

4. **Multi-Language Support**: Future collaboration on Indigenous language support in standards documentation.

5. **FNTC Endorsement**: If appropriate, FNTC endorsement of NCI standards for use by First Nations organizations.

**What We Offer**

- **Free Tools**: All NCI standards are public domain, free for use and adaptation
- **Practical Frameworks**: Not just principles, but templates organizations can use
- **Regional Focus**: Designed for Northern BC, but principles applicable everywhere
- **ISO Alignment**: Works with international standards (ISO 42001), doesn't replace them

**Next Steps**

I'm reaching out with humility and respect for FNTC's expertise. I'd be grateful for:

- A conversation to discuss how NCI can align with FNTC's mission
- Feedback on NC-AI-001 from an Indigenous data sovereignty perspective
- Collaboration on standards that serve First Nations communities

I'm happy to:
- Meet in person (Vancouver or Terrace) or via video call
- Share our draft standards for review
- Attend FNTC events or meetings
- Listen and learn from FNTC's priorities and concerns

**The Template**

NC-AI-001 is available for review at: kaizenstrategic.ai/NCI-AI-Governance

I've also shared it on GitHub for transparent collaboration: github.com/EsotericShadow/nc-ai-templates

**Thank You**

Thank you for FNTC's important work advancing Indigenous technology and data sovereignty. I look forward to the possibility of collaboration.

With respect,

Hi [Denise/Name],

I'm reaching out about the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI), a new non-profit I've initiated to develop regional AI governance standards for Northern BC.

A core principle is respect for Indigenous sovereignty and data rights. Given FNTC's leadership in Indigenous technology and data sovereignty, I'd love to explore how NCI can align with and support FNTC's mission.

Would you be open to a brief conversation? I'm happy to share our draft standards and discuss partnership opportunities.

Best,
Gabriel Lacroix
