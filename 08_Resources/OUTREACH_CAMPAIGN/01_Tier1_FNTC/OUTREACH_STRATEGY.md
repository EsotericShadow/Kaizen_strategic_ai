## Potential Objections & Responses

### "We're Vancouver-focused, not Northern BC"
**Response**: "We recognize that. NCI focuses Northern BC, but Indigenous data sovereignty principles apply everywhere. Partnership could benefit all First Nations in BC."

### "We already have frameworks"
**Response**: "Absolutely. We're not replacing FNTC frameworks. We're asking how NCI standards can align with and support OCAP® principles and existing FNTC work."

### "We need to see value first"
**Response**: "Understood. We're happy to share NC-AI-001 for review, attend FNTC events, and demonstrate our commitment through actions, not just words."
