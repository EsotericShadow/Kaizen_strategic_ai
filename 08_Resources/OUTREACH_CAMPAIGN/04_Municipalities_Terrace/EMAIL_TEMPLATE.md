## Email Template

Dear Mayor Bujtas (or City Manager),

I'm writing to introduce the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI) and a resource that may be valuable for City of Terrace's operations.

**About NCI**

I've initiated NCI as a Terrace-based non-profit developing regional AI governance standards for Northern BC. We've published **NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template**, a free, ISO 42001-aligned tool for organizations implementing AI systems.

**Why This Matters for Terrace**

As Terrace considers or adopts AI systems (planning, services, operations), comprehensive governance becomes important. NC-AI-001 provides a practical framework that:

- **Addresses municipal needs**: Designed for organizations like cities
- **Free and accessible**: No cost to Terrace
- **ISO-aligned**: Meets international standards
- **Local expertise**: Developed right here in Terrace

**Local Partnership Opportunity**

Since NCI is Terrace-based, we'd love to partner with the City:
- **Early Adopter**: Terrace could be first municipality to adopt
- **Case Study**: City's experience would inform future standards
- **Local Collaboration**: Direct partnership opportunity

**What We're Offering**

1. **Free templates** (PDF, Word, CSV, Markdown)
2. **Implementation support** (if helpful)
3. **Ongoing updates** based on feedback

**Next Steps**

Would City of Terrace be interested in:

- **Reviewing NC-AI-001** for municipal use?
- **Partnership discussion** as local early adopter?
- **Presentation to council** (if appropriate)?

I'm happy to:
- Meet in person (I'm local)
- Present to council or staff
- Provide implementation support

**The Template**

NC-AI-001 is available at: kaizenstrategic.ai/NCI-AI-Governance

**Thank You**

Thank you for City of Terrace's leadership in municipal governance.

Best regards,
