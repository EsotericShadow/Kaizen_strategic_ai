**Message**:

Hi [CAO Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from last week about the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance and NC-AI-001 template.

I understand regional districts have many priorities. If this isn't timely right now, I completely understand. If helpful, I'm happy to:

- Share the template for your review when convenient
- Provide more information about how it might benefit [District Name]
- Connect at a future time

If there's a better contact person or department for this type of inquiry, I'd appreciate guidance.

Thank you,
Gabriel Lacroix

### If POSITIVE Response Received

**Thank You Email**:

Thank you for your interest! I'm glad [District Name] is interested in AI governance.

[Customize based on what they're interested in]

Would you prefer to:
- Review NC-AI-001 first?
- Schedule a presentation to board/staff?
- Discuss implementation support?
- Meet to discuss further?

Best regards,
Gabriel Lacroix

### If Adoption/Endorsement Achieved

**Case Study Request**:

Thank you for adopting/endorsing NC-AI-001. This is valuable validation for NCI.

Would [District Name] be open to:
- A brief case study on how you're using the template?
- A testimonial (if appropriate)?
- Public mention in NCI materials?

I'm happy to work with you on any approach that's comfortable.

Thank you,
Gabriel Lacroix
