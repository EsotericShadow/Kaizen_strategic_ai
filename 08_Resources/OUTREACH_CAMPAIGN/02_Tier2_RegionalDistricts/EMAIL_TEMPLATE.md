## Email Template (Customize for Each District)

Dear [CAO Name],

I'm writing to introduce the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI) and a new resource that may be valuable for [Regional District Name]'s AI governance needs.

**About NCI**

I've initiated NCI as a non-profit developing regional AI governance standards specifically for Northern BC. We've published **NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template**, a free, ISO 42001-aligned tool to help organizations systematically assess and manage AI risks.

**Why This Matters for Regional Districts**

As regional districts adopt AI systems (planning, services, operations, data management), comprehensive governance becomes critical. NC-AI-001 provides a practical framework that:

- **Complements existing policies**: Works alongside district AI policies (like [District's policy if known])
- **Provides implementation tools**: Not just principles, but templates you can use
- **Addresses regional contexts**: Designed for Northern BC's unique challenges
- **ISO-aligned**: Meets international standards for credibility

**What We're Offering**

1. **Free templates** (PDF, Word, CSV, Markdown) - no cost
2. **Implementation support** (if helpful)
3. **Workshop opportunities** for district staff
4. **Ongoing updates** based on feedback from users like you

**Particularly Relevant for [District Name]**

[Customize based on research]

**Example for Bulkley-Nechako**:
"We noticed [District Name] adopted an AI staff policy in September 2025. NC-AI-001 could complement this policy by providing a detailed risk assessment framework your team can use to implement AI governance systematically."

**Next Steps**

Would [Regional District Name] be interested in:

- **Reviewing NC-AI-001** for your AI governance needs?
- **A presentation** to your board or staff (if appropriate)?
- **Using the template** to enhance your existing AI governance framework?
- **Providing feedback** to improve future versions?

I'm happy to:
- Meet in person or via video call
- Present to your board (if that's useful)
- Provide implementation guidance
- Listen to your district's specific needs

**The Template**

NC-AI-001 is available at: kaizenstrategic.ai/NCI-AI-Governance

It's also on GitHub: github.com/EsotericShadow/nc-ai-templates

**Thank You**

Thank you for [District Name]'s leadership in regional governance. I hope NC-AI-001 can support your work.

Best regards,

## Customization Notes

**For Bulkley-Nechako**:
- Mention their September 2025 AI policy
- Position NC-AI-001 as implementation tool for that policy
- Emphasize complement, not replacement

**For Other Districts**:
- Mention general AI governance needs
- Position as proactive tool before policy adoption
- Emphasize free, no-commitment review
