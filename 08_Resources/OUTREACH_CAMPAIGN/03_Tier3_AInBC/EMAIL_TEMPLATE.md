## Email Template

Dear Rob (or Steve, if Executive Director),

I'm writing to introduce the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI) and explore potential collaboration with AI Network of BC.

**About NCI**

I've initiated NCI as a non-profit developing regional AI governance standards specifically for Northern BC (north of Prince George). We've published **NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template**, a free, ISO 42001-aligned tool for organizations implementing AI systems.

**Alignment with AInBC**

AInBC builds the provincial AI ecosystem, while NCI creates regional standards. Our work is complimentary - AInBC builds networks, NCI provides practical tools. I'd like NCI to participate in the provincial network while contributing Northern BC perspectives.

**What We Offer**

- **Regional Standards**: Practical tools for Northern BC organizations
- **Northern BC Expertise**: Regional perspective on AI governance
- **Network Participation**: Contribute to provincial AI ecosystem

**Partnership Opportunities**

I'd like to explore:

1. **Network Participation**: NCI as part of AInBC network
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Best practices exchange
3. **Cross-Promotion**: Promote each other's initiatives
4. **Events**: Participation in AInBC events

**Next Steps**

Would AInBC be interested in:
- **Network participation** discussion?
- **Knowledge sharing** opportunities?
- **Introduction** to AInBC network?

**The Template**

NC-AI-001 is available at: kaizenstrategic.ai/NCI-AI-Governance

Best regards,
