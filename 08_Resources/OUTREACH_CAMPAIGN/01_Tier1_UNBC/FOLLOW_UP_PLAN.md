# UNBC Follow-Up Plan

**Organization**: University of Northern British Columbia  
**Priority**: CRITICAL

---

## Follow-Up Sequence

### If NO Response After Initial Email (Week 4)

#### Follow-Up Email #1 (7 days after initial)

**Subject**: Re: Research Partnership - Northern Cascadia Institute

**Message**:

Hi UNBC Research Team,

I wanted to follow up on my email from last week about the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance and potential research partnership opportunities with UNBC.

I understand UNBC receives many inquiries. If this isn't a priority right now, I completely understand. I'm particularly interested in:

- Academic validation of NC-AI-001
- Research partnerships on regional AI governance
- Connecting with AI researchers at UNBC

If there's a better contact person for this type of inquiry, or if you'd prefer I reach out at a different time, I'd appreciate guidance.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Gabriel Lacroix

### If STILL No Response (Week 5)

#### Follow-Up Email #2 (14 days after initial)

**Alternative Approach**: Try specific researcher contact

**If you have Dr. Je Sen Teh contact**:
- Send separate email focused on research collaboration
- Different angle: Research questions, not just partnership

**Or try Provost Office directly**:
- Different email, CC Research Office
- Focus on community engagement angle

### If POSITIVE Response Received

**Thank You Email**:

Thank you so much for your interest! I'm excited about the possibility of collaborating with UNBC.

[Customize based on interest area]

Would you prefer to:
- Schedule a call to discuss partnership opportunities?
- Review NC-AI-001 first?
- Connect with specific researchers?
- Meet in person (I can come to Prince George or we can meet virtually)?

Looking forward to continuing the conversation.

Best,
Gabriel
