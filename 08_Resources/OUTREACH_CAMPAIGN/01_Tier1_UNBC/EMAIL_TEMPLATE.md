## Email Template

Dear UNBC Research Team,

I'm writing to introduce the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI) and explore potential research partnership opportunities with UNBC.

**About NCI**

I've initiated NCI as a non-profit developing regional AI governance standards specifically for Northern BC (north of Prince George). We've just published our first standard, **NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template** (v1.0, Draft for Public Comment), an ISO 42001-aligned tool designed for organizations implementing AI systems in Northern BC contexts.

**Why UNBC Partnership Matters**

Both UNBC and NCI serve Northern BC with regional focus and expertise. NCI standards address unique Northern BC challenges:
- Resource-based economies (mining, forestry)
- Remote/low-density communities
- Small organizations (5-50 employees)
- Indigenous sovereignty considerations

UNBC's research capabilities could validate and strengthen these standards through:
- Academic review and validation
- Research partnerships
- Case studies from Northern BC organizations
- Co-publication of white papers

**Partnership Opportunities**

I'd like to explore collaboration on:

1. **Academic Validation**: UNBC review of NC-AI-001 for academic rigor and practical effectiveness
2. **Research Partnership**: Co-research on regional AI governance needs and best practices
3. **Co-Publication**: White papers on AI governance in Northern BC resource economies
4. **Case Studies**: Validation through real-world implementation in Northern BC organizations
5. **Student Engagement**: Internships, research projects, thesis opportunities

**What We Offer**

- **Research Subject**: Standards, templates, and Northern BC organizations using them
- **Regional Expertise**: Deep understanding of Northern BC contexts
- **Practical Tools**: Templates for validation and case studies
- **Collaboration**: Partnership on research questions and publications

**Why This Matters**

Northern BC has unique AI governance needs that aren't addressed by generic frameworks. NCI is creating regionally-tailored standards, and academic validation from UNBC would:
- Strengthen credibility of standards
- Contribute to Northern BC knowledge base
- Provide research opportunities for UNBC
- Benefit regional organizations

**Next Steps**

Would UNBC be interested in:

- **Academic Review**: Reviewing NC-AI-001 for validation?
- **Research Partnership**: Co-developing research on regional AI governance?
- **Researcher Connection**: Connecting with AI researchers (e.g., Dr. Je Sen Teh) for collaboration?
- **Discussion**: A meeting to explore partnership opportunities?

I'm happy to:
- Meet in person (Terrace or Prince George) or via video call
- Share NC-AI-001 for review
- Discuss research questions and methodologies
- Develop partnership proposal

**The Template**

NC-AI-001 is available for review at: kaizenstrategic.ai/NCI-AI-Governance

It's also on GitHub: github.com/EsotericShadow/nc-ai-templates

**Thank You**

Thank you for UNBC's important work advancing Northern BC through research. I look forward to the possibility of collaboration.

Best regards,

## Alternative: Email to Specific Researcher

**To**: [Dr. Je Sen Teh email or LinkedIn]  
**Subject**: Research Collaboration: AI Governance Standards for Northern BC

**Template**:

Dear Dr. Teh,

I'm reaching out about potential research collaboration on regional AI governance standards.

I've initiated the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI) and published NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template, an ISO 42001-aligned framework for Northern BC organizations.

Given your research in cybersecurity and AI, I'd be interested in exploring:

- Research validation of regional AI governance frameworks
- Collaboration on AI governance research questions
- Connection to UNBC's broader research community

Would you be open to a conversation about potential collaboration?

Best,
Gabriel Lacroix
