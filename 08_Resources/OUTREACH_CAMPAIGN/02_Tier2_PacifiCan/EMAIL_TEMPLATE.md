## Email Template

Dear PacifiCan Team,

I'm writing to inquire about the Regional AI Initiative (RAII) program and how it might support the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI).

**About NCI**

I've initiated NCI as a non-profit developing regional AI governance standards specifically for Northern BC (north of Prince George). We've published **NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template**, a free, ISO 42001-aligned tool designed for remote communities, resource economies, and small organizations.

**Why NCI May Qualify for RAII**

Based on RAII's focus on supporting not-for-profits building AI ecosystems in remote/northern areas, NCI appears to align:

- **Non-Profit**: NCI is being incorporated as a non-profit society
- **Regional Focus**: Northern BC (specifically remote/northern communities north of Prince George)
- **Ecosystem Building**: Creating standards, training programs, partnerships, and resources
- **Focus Areas**: 
  - **Health**: AI governance for healthcare organizations
  - **Environment**: AI in resource sectors (mining, forestry)
  - **Economic Resilience**: Supporting small organizations with practical tools

**What RAII Funding Would Support**

If eligible, RAII funding would support:

1. **Standards Development**: NC-AI-002 (Implementation Guide), NC-AI-006 (Indigenous Data Sovereignty Protocol)
2. **Training Programs**: Workshops and training for Northern BC organizations
3. **Annual Summit**: AI & Technology Summit convening regional stakeholders
4. **Partnership Development**: Indigenous, academic, and business partnerships
5. **Regional Outreach**: Adoption and awareness across Northern BC

**Questions**

I'd like to understand:

1. Is NCI eligible for RAII funding? (Non-profit, regional focus, ecosystem building)
2. What is the application process and timeline?
3. What are the specific requirements and deliverables?
4. Who should I contact for program guidance?

**Next Steps**

I'm happy to:
- Provide more information about NCI
- Discuss how NCI aligns with RAII goals
- Complete any preliminary steps needed
- Connect with a program officer

**Thank You**

Thank you for PacifiCan's support of regional AI development. I look forward to learning more about RAII and whether NCI might be a good fit.
