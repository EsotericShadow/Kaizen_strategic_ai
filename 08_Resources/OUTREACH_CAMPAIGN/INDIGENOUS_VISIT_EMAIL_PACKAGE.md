Dear [Chief Name] and [Band Name] Council,

I'm writing to introduce the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI) and to request the opportunity to visit [Band Name] on **[VISIT DATE]** to discuss a potential partnership opportunity.

**About NCI**

I've initiated NCI as a non-profit developing regional AI governance standards specifically for Northern BC. We've published **NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template**, a free, ISO 42001-aligned tool for organizations implementing AI systems.

**Core Commitment: Indigenous Data Sovereignty**

A foundational principle of NCI is respect for Indigenous sovereignty and data rights. We recognize that:
- Indigenous governments have jurisdiction over AI governance on their territories
- Data sovereignty is critical (aligned with OCAP® principles)
- Indigenous perspectives must inform standards development
- Partnership with Indigenous organizations is essential, not optional

**What We're Offering**

1. **Free Tools**: NC-AI-001 template (PDF, Word, CSV) - no cost
2. **Partnership Opportunity**: Co-develop Indigenous data sovereignty standards
3. **Collaboration**: Work together on AI governance frameworks
4. **Support**: Resources and training for Indigenous organizations

**What We're Seeking**

1. **Input**: Feedback on NC-AI-001 from Indigenous data sovereignty perspective
2. **Partnership**: Collaboration on Indigenous-inclusive standards
3. **Co-Development**: Work together on NC-AI-006 (Indigenous Data Sovereignty Protocol)
4. **Guidance**: Learn from [Band Name]'s priorities and concerns

**Visit Details**

**Date**: [VISIT DATE]  
**Time**: [TIME - e.g., "10:00 AM - 12:00 PM, or at your convenience"]  
**Duration**: 1-2 hours (flexible based on your schedule)  
**Location**: [Band Office or preferred location]  
**Purpose**: Partnership discussion, information sharing, listening

**What We'll Discuss**

1. **NCI Introduction**: Who we are, what we're doing
2. **NC-AI-001 Overview**: The template we've created
3. **Partnership Opportunities**: How we can collaborate
4. **Your Priorities**: What [Band Name] needs from AI governance
5. **Data Sovereignty**: How NCI standards can respect sovereignty

**What We'll Bring**

- NC-AI-001 template (printed copies)
- Information package (this email + attachments)
- Partnership proposal (if interested)
- Respect and willingness to listen and learn

**Information Package Attached**

This email includes:

**Next Steps**

If you'd prefer to discuss by phone first, I'm happy to call. You can reach me at [Your Phone] or email governance@kaizenstrategic.ai.
