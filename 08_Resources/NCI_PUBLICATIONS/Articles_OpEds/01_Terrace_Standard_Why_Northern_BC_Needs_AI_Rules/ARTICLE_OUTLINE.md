## Article Structure

### Opening Hook (100-150 words)
**Goal**: Capture attention, establish local relevance

**Options**:
1. **Scenario Opening**: "Imagine a Terrace logging company using AI to optimize operations. The AI works great—until it makes decisions based on data from Vancouver's urban context, where it was trained. The result? Recommendations that don't fit Northern BC's reality."

2. **Question Opening**: "As AI systems become common in Northern BC businesses, who's making sure they work for us—not just for Vancouver or Toronto?"

3. **Local Connection**: "I'm writing this from Terrace, where I've initiated the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance. Here's why Northern BC needs its own approach to AI governance."

### Main Body (400-500 words)

#### Section 1: The Problem (150 words)
**Why Generic Frameworks Don't Work**

- **Urban Bias**: AI trained on urban data fails in remote contexts
- **Size Mismatch**: International standards assume large organizations (we have small businesses)
- **Resource Reality**: Our economies (mining, forestry, energy) have unique AI needs
- **Indigenous Sovereignty**: Generic frameworks don't address data sovereignty

**Examples**:
- Small businesses can't afford compliance teams
- Remote communities face connectivity challenges
- Resource sectors need industry-specific governance

#### Section 2: The Solution (150 words)
**Northern Cascadia Institute's Regional Approach**

- **What We're Doing**: Developing regional AI governance standards
- **NC-AI-001**: Free risk register template (28 risks, ISO-aligned)
- **Regional Focus**: Designed for Northern BC contexts
- **Practical Tools**: Not just principles, but templates you can use

**Key Points**:
- Free and accessible (public domain)
- Works with ISO standards (doesn't replace them)
- Built-in Indigenous considerations
- Small-organization friendly

#### Section 3: Why This Matters (150 words)
**Local Benefits**

- **Business Protection**: Risk management for AI adoption
- **Regional Authority**: Northern BC leading its own governance
- **Indigenous Partnership**: Respecting data sovereignty
- **Economic Growth**: Safe AI adoption enables innovation

**Call to Action**:

- Partner with NCI (Indigenous, business, government)

### Closing (50-100 words)
