## 2. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Principles (1 page)

### OCAP® Principles
- **Ownership**: Indigenous nations own their data
- **Control**: Indigenous nations control data collection and use
- **Access**: Indigenous nations access their data
- **Possession**: Indigenous nations physically possess their data

### Application to AI
- **Training Data**: Consent required for AI training data
- **AI Systems**: Indigenous control over AI used in communities
- **Data Storage**: Local/sovereign data storage options
- **Decision-Making**: Indigenous involvement in AI governance

### Additional Principles
- **Free, Prior, Informed Consent (FPIC)**: Required for AI projects
- **Traditional Knowledge Protection**: Cultural knowledge not exploited
- **Community Benefit**: AI projects benefit communities
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: AI respects Indigenous values

## 3. AI Governance Framework for Indigenous Contexts (1-2 pages)

### Framework Components

#### 3.1 Pre-Implementation Phase
- **Consent Process**: FPIC for AI projects
- **Community Engagement**: Indigenous involvement from start
- **Data Assessment**: Identify Indigenous data being used
- **Rights Recognition**: Acknowledge Indigenous sovereignty

#### 3.2 Implementation Phase
- **Indigenous-Led Governance**: Community controls AI systems
- **Data Sovereignty**: Local/sovereign data storage
- **Cultural Protocols**: Respect traditional knowledge
- **Community Benefits**: Ensure positive outcomes

#### 3.3 Ongoing Governance
- **Continuous Consent**: Regular community input
- **Data Control**: Indigenous ownership maintained
- **Cultural Protection**: Traditional knowledge safeguarded
- **Accountability**: Transparent to communities

### Regional Adaptations
- Northern BC First Nations contexts
- Small community considerations
- Remote community challenges
- Resource sector partnerships

## 4. Practical Implementation (1 page)

### For Indigenous Organizations
1. **Data Inventory**: Document all data and AI systems
2. **Sovereignty Assessment**: Evaluate data ownership/control
3. **Governance Structure**: Indigenous-led AI governance
4. **Partner Requirements**: Set expectations for partners

### For Non-Indigenous Organizations
1. **Partnership Approach**: Collaborate, don't dictate
2. **Consent First**: Obtain FPIC before AI projects
3. **Sovereignty Respect**: Acknowledge Indigenous data rights
4. **Community Benefits**: Ensure positive outcomes

### For AI Developers
1. **Consent for Training Data**: Obtain Indigenous consent
2. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect traditional knowledge
3. **Community Engagement**: Involve Indigenous communities
4. **Sovereign Storage**: Offer local data storage
