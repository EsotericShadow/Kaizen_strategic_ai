## 1. Introduction (1/2 page)

### Purpose and Scope
- Explain need for localized AI governance amid global AI growth
- Focus on Northern BC's unique context:
  - Low population density
  - Resource-based economies (mining, forestry, energy)
  - Remote communities
  - Indigenous sovereignty
  - Small organizations (5-50 employees)

### Problem Statement
- **AI's Potential**: Predictive analytics, automation, efficiency gains
- **AI's Risks**: Without proper governance:
  - Privacy breaches in isolated communities
  - Bias in resource allocation
  - Job displacement in resource sectors
  - Data sovereignty violations
  - Regulatory non-compliance

### NCI's Role
- Building on NC-AI-001 (risk register template)
- Aligned with ISO 42001:2023
- Works with international standards, doesn't replace them
- First regional framework specifically for Northern BC

## 2. Background: AI in Northern BC's Resource Economies (1 page)

### Current Landscape
- **AI Adoption Trends in Regional Industries**:
  - Mining: Predictive maintenance, safety monitoring, resource optimization
  - Forestry: Inventory management, environmental monitoring, supply chain
  - Energy: Grid optimization, demand forecasting
  - Tourism: Customer service, booking systems
  - Municipalities: Planning, services, operations

### Regional Challenges
- **Infrastructure**: Unreliable internet, limited connectivity
- **Expertise**: Limited AI talent pool in region
- **Resources**: Small organizations lack compliance teams
- **Power Constraints**: Bill 31 prioritizes resources over AI data centers
- **Climate**: Harsh environments, remote operations
- **Indigenous Data Rights**: Sovereignty considerations

### Global Context
- Brief overview of existing frameworks:
  - ISO 42001:2023 (AI Management Systems)
  - EU AI Act
  - NIST AI Risk Management Framework
  - OECD AI Principles
- Why they need regional adaptation:
  - Designed for large organizations
  - Urban-focused
  - Don't address remote/resource contexts
  - Too complex for small organizations

## 3. Key Risks and Opportunities (1 page)

### Risks by Category (Using NC-AI-001 Framework)

#### 1. Bias and Fairness
- **Regional Examples**: 
  - Hiring AI favoring urban candidates
  - Resource allocation algorithms disadvantaging remote communities
  - AI systems trained on urban data failing in Northern BC contexts

#### 2. Security and Privacy
- **Regional Examples**:
  - Data breaches in isolated communities (difficult recovery)
  - Privacy violations in small communities (everyone knows everyone)
  - Remote access security challenges

#### 3. Data Quality and Integrity
- **Regional Examples**:
  - Limited data sets (smaller populations)
  - Connectivity issues affecting data collection
  - Resource industry-specific data challenges

#### 4. Regulatory Compliance
- **Regional Examples**:
  - BC Bill 31 power allocation impacts
  - Indigenous data sovereignty requirements
  - Municipal vs. provincial vs. federal compliance

### Opportunities

#### 1. Economic Growth
- AI for resource sector optimization
- Cost reduction in remote operations
- New tech jobs in region

#### 2. Sustainability
- AI for energy efficiency
- Environmental monitoring
- Resource conservation

#### 3. Community Resilience
- Predictive maintenance for infrastructure
- Emergency response optimization
- Service delivery improvements

## 4. Proposed Governance Framework (1-2 pages)

### Core Components

#### 4.1 Framework Structure
1. **AI Inventory**: Document all AI systems in use
2. **Risk Assessment**: Use NC-AI-001 template
3. **Policies & Standards**: Based on ISO 42001, adapted regionally
4. **Controls & Mitigation**: Practical measures for small organizations
5. **Monitoring & Review**: Ongoing governance (not one-time)

#### 4.2 Regional Adaptations

**For Small Organizations (5-50 employees)**:
- Simplified steering committee (1-2 people, not 10-person team)
- Practical controls (don't require enterprise tools)
- Affordable solutions (free templates, low-cost tools)
- Time-efficient processes (not bureaucratic)

**For Remote Communities**:
- Offline-capable tools
- Connectivity-aware systems
- Local data storage options
- Redundancy for unreliable connections

**For Resource Sectors**:
- Industry-specific risk categories
- Operational technology (OT) integration
- Harsh environment considerations
- Supply chain AI governance

**For Indigenous Organizations**:
- Built-in data sovereignty considerations
- OCAP® principles alignment
- Traditional knowledge protection
- Indigenous-led governance models

#### 4.3 Integration with Standards
- **ISO 42001**: How NCI framework aligns with international standard
- **Provincial Policies**: BC Responsible AI Use principles
- **Federal Frameworks**: Canadian AI Strategy alignment
- **Industry Standards**: Sector-specific compliance

## 5. Implementation Guidance (1 page)

### Step-by-Step Adoption Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Assessment (Week 1-2)
1. **Inventory AI Systems**: List all AI in use
2. **Risk Assessment**: Use NC-AI-001 template
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify governance gaps
4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve key people

#### Phase 2: Governance Structure (Week 3-4)
1. **Steering Committee**: 1-2 people (for small orgs)
