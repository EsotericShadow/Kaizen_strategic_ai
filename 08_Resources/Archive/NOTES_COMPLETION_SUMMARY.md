## Publication Format Findings

**Research Conducted**: Deep dive into ISO document formats

**Key Finding**: Professional templates need **PDF + Word + Excel**, not just Markdown

**Result**: Markdown is source format, but PDF/Word/Excel are essential for publication

**Current State**: We have source materials and instructions - users can create final formats themselves
