## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Format
- Markdown for comprehensive review
- CSV for spreadsheet-based assessment

### Step 2: Define Your Scope
Before assessing risks, clearly define:
- Which AI system(s) are you assessing?
- What is the intended use?
- Who are the affected stakeholders?
- What is your role? (Developer / Provider / User / Multiple)

### Step 3: Assess Risks
For each relevant risk:
1. Assign Impact score (1-5)
2. Assign Likelihood score (1-5)
3. Calculate Risk Score (Impact × Likelihood)
4. Identify existing or planned controls
5. Assign ownership and target dates

### Step 4: Prioritize Treatment
Focus on:
- **Extreme (20-25)**: Immediate action required
- **High (15-19)**: Treatment within 30 days
- **Medium (10-14)**: Treatment within 90 days

### Step 5: Implement and Monitor
- Document control implementation
- Track progress regularly
- Re-assess quarterly
- Update annually
