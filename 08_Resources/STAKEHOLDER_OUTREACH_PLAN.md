Dear [Chief/Council/Administration],

I'm writing to introduce the Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI), a new non-profit organization developing AI governance standards for Northern BC.

**What is NCI?**

We've just published NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template, a free tool aligned with ISO 42001 to help organizations manage AI risks. This is designed specifically for Northern BC contexts.

**Why We're Reaching Out**

We recognize that Indigenous governments have sovereignty over their territories and data. We want to ensure our standards work for First Nations communities and respect data sovereignty principles.

**What We're Asking**

1. **Input**: We'd value your feedback on NC-AI-001 and what your communities need
2. **Partnership**: We're interested in collaborative development of governance frameworks
3. **Awareness**: Making sure you're aware these resources exist and are free

**Next Steps**

Would you be open to a brief conversation? I'm happy to:
- Meet in person if you prefer
- Provide more information
- Discuss partnership opportunities
- Listen to your concerns and priorities

The template is available at: kaizenstrategic.ai/NCI-AI-Governance
