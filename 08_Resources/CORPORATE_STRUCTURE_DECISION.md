- **Relationship**: To be determined

---

## Option A: NCI as Subsidiary of Kaizen

### Structure
```
Kaizen Strategic AI (For-Profit)
└── Northern Cascadia Institute (Non-Profit Subsidiary/Division)
```

### Legal Structure

- Shared legal entity, separate branding
- Possibly a "division" or "program" rather than separate incorporation

### Pros

   - No separate incorporation needed
   - Single legal entity
   - Easier to manage initially

✅ **Shared Resources**
   - Kaizen provides administrative support
   - Shared office space, systems, staff
   - Lower overhead

✅ **Financial Simplicity**
   - Single accounting system
   - Easier tax filing

   - Kaizen maintains control over NCI direction
   - Unified decision-making

### Cons
❌ **Perceived Independence**
   - May appear less independent
   - Potential conflict of interest perception
   - "Commercial entity owns non-profit" perception

❌ **Grants & Funding**
   - Harder to qualify for grants (owned by for-profit)
   - Government funding may be restricted
   - Donations may not be tax-deductible for donors

❌ **Partnership Challenges**
   - Indigenous governments may prefer independent entity
   - Municipalities may have concerns about commercial influence
   - Academic partnerships may be restricted

❌ **Non-Profit Status Complexity**
   - True non-profit status difficult within for-profit structure
   - Tax-exempt status may not be possible
   - Charitable status impossible

## Option B: Separate Entity (RECOMMENDED)

### Structure
```

Northern Cascadia Institute (Separate Non-Profit Corporation)
    (Independent, but Kaizen may be founder/donor)
```

### Legal Structure
- NCI is a separate, independent legal entity
- Incorporated under BC Society Act or Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act
- Separate board of directors
- Separate bank account, financial systems

### Pros

   - Eligible for foundation grants
   - Can receive tax-deductible donations (if charitable status obtained)

✅ **Partnership Opportunities**

   - Academic institutions can partner formally
   - Government agencies can contract/work with NCI

✅ **Legal Clarity**

   - Board meetings and governance

❌ **Funding Needs**
   - NCI needs its own funding source
   - Kaizen can donate, but separate budgets

---

## Recommendation: Option B (Separate Entity)

### Rationale

1. **Mission Clarity**: For-profit and non-profit have different missions. Clear separation avoids confusion.

2. **Partnership Readiness**: Indigenous governments, municipalities, and academic institutions prefer working with independent non-profits.

3. **Grant Eligibility**: Many grants require independent non-profit status. This opens funding opportunities.

4. **Credibility**: As a standards-setting body, independence is critical for authority and trust.

5. **Long-term Viability**: Separate structure allows NCI to grow independently, even if Kaizen changes direction.

6. **Professionalism**: Separate incorporation shows serious commitment and professional approach.

### Implementation Steps (If Option B Chosen)

#### Step 1: Legal Structure Selection
- **BC Society Act** (simpler, provincial)
- **Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act** (federal, more complex, better for national presence)
- **Recommendation**: BC Society Act initially (can convert later)

#### Step 2: Incorporation Requirements
- **Name**: "Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance" (or similar)
- **Directors**: Minimum 3 (you + 2 others)
- **Purpose**: Non-profit purposes (education, research, standards development)
- **Structure**: Society or corporation

#### Step 3: Legal & Accounting
- Consult lawyer for incorporation
- Consult accountant for tax-exempt application
- Budget: $500-2000 for setup

#### Step 4: Governance
- Board of directors (minimum 3)
- Bylaws
- First board meeting
- Officers (President, Secretary, Treasurer)

#### Step 5: Financial Setup
- Separate bank account
- Accounting system
- Budget planning

#### Step 6: Relationship with Kaizen
- Kaizen can be founder/donor
- Kaizen can provide services (for reasonable fees)
- Clear separation of activities
- Disclosure of relationship in NCI materials

## Hybrid Approach (If Budget Constrained)

### Phase 1: Start as Subsidiary
- Launch NCI as division of Kaizen
- Build credibility and track record
- Establish partnerships

### Phase 2: Separate Later
- Incorporate as separate entity after 6-12 months
- Transfer assets and operations
- Maintain relationships

**Note**: This may require rebranding/explanation, but is feasible if budget is tight initially.

## Questions to Answer

1. **Budget**: Can we afford separate incorporation ($500-2000)?
2. **Timeline**: Do we need NCI operational immediately, or can we wait for incorporation?
3. **Board**: Do we have 2-3 people willing to serve on board?
4. **Legal Counsel**: Do we have access to lawyer for incorporation?
5. **Funding**: How will NCI be funded initially? (Kaizen donation, grants, other?)

---

## Decision Framework

Choose **Option A (Subsidiary)** if:
- Budget is extremely tight
- Need to launch immediately
- Willing to separate later
- Comfortable with perceived commercial connection

Choose **Option B (Separate)** if:
- Want maximum credibility
- Planning for grants and partnerships
- Can afford setup costs
- Want professional structure
- Long-term independence is important

---

**RECOMMENDATION: Option B (Separate Entity)**

Given the goals of:
- Establishing NCI as authoritative standards body
- Partnering with Indigenous governments
- Securing grants and funding
- Building long-term credibility

**Separate incorporation is the better choice.**

## Next Steps (If Option B Chosen)

2. Identify 2-3 board members
3. Consult with lawyer
4. Choose NCI legal name
5. Draft bylaws
6. File incorporation
