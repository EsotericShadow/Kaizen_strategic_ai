# NCI Strategic Positioning: Where We Fit in Northern BC AI Governance

**Status**: Strategic Analysis Complete  
**Created**: 2025-11-02  
**Purpose**: Map the landscape, identify NCI's position, and define opportunities

---

## Executive Summary

**The Gap**: Northern BC (north of Prince George) has **ZERO dedicated AI governance standards bodies** or organizations focused on regional AI risk management.

**NCI's Position**: **FIRST MOVER** in Northern BC AI governance. We're creating the first regional framework specifically designed for Northern BC's unique context.

**Key Insight**: Provincial and federal AI governance exists, but it's:
- Vancouver/urban-focused
- Generic (not tailored to resource economies)
- Doesn't address Northern BC's specific challenges
- Not accessible to small organizations

**NCI's Opportunity**: Fill the gap with practical, accessible, regionally-tailored standards.

## Competitive Analysis: Who Does What

### Standards Development
| Organization | Geographic Focus | Target Audience | Standards Type |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **ISO** | Global | All organizations | Generic international |
| **BC Government** | Provincial | Public sector | Provincial principles |
| **AInBC** | Provincial | Ecosystem | Guidelines |
| **NCI** | **Northern BC** | **Small orgs, municipalities, Indigenous** | **Regional templates** |

### Key Differentiator
**NCI is the ONLY organization creating regionally-tailored, practical, ISO-aligned AI governance templates specifically for Northern BC contexts.**

---

## NCI's Strategic Position: The Gap We Fill

### Gap 1: Regional Standards
**Problem**: No standards specifically for Northern BC's:
- Resource-based economies
- Remote/low-density communities
- Small organizations (5-50 employees)
- Indigenous sovereignty context

**NCI Solution**: NC-AI-001 tailored for these contexts

### Gap 2: Accessibility
**Problem**: ISO 42001 is complex, expensive, requires expertise

**NCI Solution**: Free, accessible templates that work WITH ISO, not replacing it

### Gap 3: Practical Implementation
**Problem**: Provincial/federal frameworks are high-level, not implementation-ready

**NCI Solution**: Step-by-step templates, real-world examples, Northern BC case studies (future)

### Gap 4: Indigenous Integration
**Problem**: Mainstream frameworks don't adequately address Indigenous data sovereignty

**NCI Solution**: Built-in Indigenous considerations, partnership with FNTC, multi-language support (future)

### Gap 5: Small Organization Support
**Problem**: Standards assume large organizations with compliance teams

**NCI Solution**: Templates designed for 5-person businesses, not 500-person corporations
