**Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance Launches First Regional AI Risk Standard**

Terrace, BC – [DATE] – The Northern Cascadia Institute of AI Governance (NCI) today announced the publication of its first regional AI governance standard, NC-AI-001: AI Risk Register Template, designed specifically for organizations in Northern BC and the broader Northern Cascadia region.

**What is NC-AI-001?**

NC-AI-001 is a comprehensive AI risk management template aligned with ISO 42001:2023 (AI Management Systems). The template includes 28 pre-populated AI risks across eight categories, helping organizations systematically identify, assess, and manage AI-related risks in their operations.

"The North faces unique challenges when implementing AI systems," said Gabriel Lacroix, founder of Kaizen Strategic AI and initiator of the Northern Cascadia Institute.
