### Strategic Reminders (for facilitator)
- Match casual, friendly tone; keep it conversational
- Determine scale first (frequency is key to ROI)
- Compare to ongoing bookkeeping cost ($250–$600/mo)
- One-time setup advantage; 4+ tournaments/year → break-even ~18–24 months

### Solution Path (Fill After Discovery)

**If Rabbit ($1–2K):**
- Basic registration form
- Simple payment processing
- Manual bracket management
- Basic reporting

**If Deer ($3–5K):**
- Automated registration system
- Integrated payments
- Automated bracket generation
- Communication automation
- Financial reporting dashboard
