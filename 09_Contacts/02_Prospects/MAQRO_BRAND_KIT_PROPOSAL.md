## Scope (Simple and Clear)
- Logo design (wordmark/mark): 2 concepts, 1 refinement
- Brand kit: color palette, typography, spacing/usage rules, avatar/social crops, 1‑page brand sheet PDF
- Final assets: SVG, PNG (light/dark), favicon

## Pricing (Pick‑and‑Choose)
- Logo design: $500
- Brand kit: $300
- Bundle: $800 (logo + brand kit)
- Hourly for extras (if any): $95/hr (nights/weekends $125/hr)

## What I Need
- 5–10 reference brands or Pinterest vision board
- 5 brand adjectives (e.g., modern, grounded, bold, minimalist, premium)
- Name styling (MAQRO vs Maqro Strategies), any tagline
- Color lean (navy/blue ok) and “no‑go” colors (no red)
- Primary use cases (select 2–3 to prioritize):
  - Site header (horizontal logo + favicon)
  - Social profiles (square/circle avatar + compact mark)
  - Documents (letterhead/print‑friendly, mono option)
  - Signage/Merch (large‑format, clear‑space rules)
  - Presentations (cover/title slide lockups)
  - Email signature (small, legible mark)

## Deliverables
- Final logo package (SVG/PNG), favicon
- Brand sheet PDF: colors (HEX/RGB/CMYK), type (web + fallbacks), usage rules
- Social/avatar crops and site icons

## Timeline
- Week 1: Vision board + 2 logo concepts
- Week 2: Refinement + brand sheet + export assets

## Process
1) Vision/mood board (45–60 min)
2) Concepts (2), selection
3) One refinement cycle
4) Final brand sheet + exports

## Notes
- Complimentary: Tonight’s 1‑hour consult logged for records
- Ownership: Client owns final logo and brand assets; working files excluded
- Revisions: One refinement included; extra rounds at $95/hr

## Acceptance & Next Steps
- Approve logo only, brand kit only, or bundle
- Pay 50% deposit; schedule vision session
